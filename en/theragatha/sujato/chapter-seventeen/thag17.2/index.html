this purpose;</p><p>This is enough to live comfortably<br>For a resolute monk.<br>When sitting cross-legged,<br>The rain doesn’t fall on the knees;</p><p>This is enough to live comfortably<br>For a resolute monk.<br>When you’ve seen happiness as suffering,<br>And suffering as a dart,</p><p>You know there’s no difference between them—<br>With what are you bound to the world?<br>What would you become?<br>When you think, ‘May I not associate</p><p>With people of bad wishes,<br>Lazy, lacking energy,<br>With little learning, disrespectful’—<br>With what are you bound to the world?</p><p>What would you become?<br>A wise person who is learned,<br>Endowed with virtues,<br>Devoted to serenity of heart—</p><p>Let them stand at the head.<br>Whoever is devoted to proliferation,<br>A wild animal delighting in proliferation,<br>Is deprived of nibbāna,</p><p>The unexcelled safety from the yoke.<br>Whoever has given up proliferation,<br>Delighting in the path free of proliferation,<br>Is blessed with nibbāna,</p><p>The unexcelled safety from the yoke.<br>Whether in the village or in the wilderness,<br>In lands low or high,<br>Wherever arahants live</p><p>Is a delightful place.<br>The wilderness is delightful!<br>Where most people find no delight,<br>Those who are free of lust delight there,</p><p>As they are not seeking sensual pleasures.<br>When you see someone who sees your faults,<br>A wise person who rebukes you,<br>You should stick close to such an intelligent person,</p><p>As if they were revealing some hidden treasure.<br>Sticking close to such a person,<br>Things get better, not worse.<br>You should advise, you should admonish;</p><p>You should curb rudeness;<br>For such a person is loved by the mindful,<br>Not loved by the unmindful.<br>The Blessed One, the Buddha, the seer</p><p>Was teaching Dhamma to another.<br>While Dhamma was being taught<br>I listened attentively, to understand the meaning—<br>My listening wasn’t wasted,</p><p>I’m liberated, without defilements.<br>Not for knowledge of past lives,<br>Nor even for clairvoyance;<br>Not for psychic powers,</p><p>Or reading the minds of others,<br>Nor for knowing people’s passing away<br>And being reborn;<br>Not for purifying the power of clairaudience,</p><p>Did I have any resolve.”<br>“His only shelter is at the foot of a tree;<br>With shaved head, wrapped in the outer robe,<br>The senior monk who is foremost in wisdom,</p><p>Upatissa himself practices jhāna.<br>Entering a meditation state without thought,<br>A disciple of the Buddha<br>Is at that moment blessed</p><p>With noble silence.<br>Just like a rocky mountain<br>Is unshakable and firmly grounded;<br>So when delusion ends,</p><p>A monk, like a mountain, doesn’t tremble.”<br>“To the blameless man<br>Who is always seeking purity,<br>Even a hair-tip of evil</p><p>Seems the size of a cloud.<br>I don’t long for death;<br>I don’t long for life;<br>I will lay down this body,</p><p>Aware and mindful.<br>I don’t long for death;<br>I don’t long for life;<br>I await my time,</p><p>Like a worker waiting for their wages.”<br>“Both before and after<br>It’s death, not the deathless,<br>Practice, don’t perish—</p><p>Don’t let the moment pass you by.<br>Just like a frontier city,<br>Guarded inside and out,<br>So you should ward yourselves</p><p>Don’t let the moment pass you by.<br>Those who pass up the moment<br>Grieve when they end up in hell.”<br>“Calm and quiet,</p><p>Wise in counsel, not restless;<br>He shakes off bad qualities<br>As the wind shakes leaves off a tree.<br>Calm and quiet,</p><p>Wise in counsel, not restless;<br>He plucks off bad qualities<br>As the wind plucks leaves off a tree.<br>Calm and sorrowless,</p><p>Clear and undisturbed,<br>Of good virtue and intelligent:<br>You should put an end to suffering.”<br>“Some householders,</p><p>And even some of those gone forth,<br>Are not to be trusted.<br>Even some who were good later become bad;<br>While some who were bad become good.</p><p>Sensual desire, ill-will,<br>Dullness and drowsiness,<br>Restlessness, and doubt:<br>These are the five mental stains for a monk.</p><p>Whoever’s samādhi does not waver,<br>Regardless of whether or not<br>They receive honours,<br>Is one who lives heedfully.</p><p>They regularly practice jhāna,<br>With subtle insight into views;<br>Delighting in the end of grasping,<br>They are said to be a good person.</p><p>Ocean, earth,<br>Mountains, wind—<br>These cannot compare<br>With the teacher’s magnificent liberation.</p><p>He is the senior monk who keeps<br>The Wheel of Dhamma rolling,<br>Possessing great knowledge and samādhi.<br>Like earth, like water, like fire,</p><p>He is neither attracted nor repelled.<br>He has attained the perfection of wisdom,<br>He has great intelligence and great discernment;<br>He is not stupid, but appears stupid;</p><p>He always wanders, quenched.<br>I’ve attended on the teacher<br>And fulfilled the Buddha’s instructions.<br>The heavy burden is laid down,</p><p>I’ve undone the attachment to being reborn<br>In any state of existence.<br>Strive on with heedfulness:<br>This is my advice.</p><p>Come, now I’ll realise nibbāna,<br>I am liberated in every way.”</p><h2 id=notes>Notes<a class=anchor href=#notes>#</a></h2></article><footer class=book-footer><div class="flex flex-wrap
