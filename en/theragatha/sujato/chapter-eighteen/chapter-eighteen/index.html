It turns your mind, and makes samādhi hard to find.
Seeing that popularity is suﬀering,
You shouldn’t accept a following.</p><p>A sage should not visit respectable families
It turns your mind, and makes samādhi hard to find.
One who’s eager and greedy for flavours,
Misses the goal that brings such happiness.</p><p>They know that this really is a bog,
This homage and veneration
Among respectable families.
Honor is a subtle dart, hard to extract,
And hard for a bad man to give up.</p><p>I came down from my lodging
And entered the city for alms.
I courteously stood by
While a leper ate.</p><p>With his putrid hand
He oﬀered me a morsel.
Putting the morsel in my bowl,
His finger broke oﬀ right there.</p><p>Leaning against the foot of a wall,
I ate that morsel.
While eating, and afterwards,
I did not feel any disgust.</p><p>Anyone who makes use of
Leftovers for food,
Putrid urine as medicine,
The root of a tree as lodging,
And rags from the rubbish-heap as robes,
Is at home in any direction.</p><p>Where some have perished
While climbing the mountain,
There Kassapa ascends;
An heir of the Buddha,
Aware and mindful,
Relying on his psychic powers.</p><p>Returning from alms-round,
Kassapa ascends the mountain,
And practices jhāna without grasping,
With fear and dread abandoned.</p><p>Returning from alms-round,
Kassapa ascends the mountain,
And practices jhāna without grasping,
Quenched amongst those who burn.</p><p>Returning from alms-round,
Kassapa ascends the mountain,
And practices jhāna without grasping,
His duty done, without defilements.</p><p>Strewn with garlands of the musk-rose tree,
These regions are delightful.
Lovely, resounding with the trumpeting of elephants:
These rocky crags delight me!</p><p>They look like blue-black storm clouds, glistening,
Cooled with the waters of clear-flowing streams,
And covered with ladybird beetles:
These rocky crags delight me!</p><p>Like the peak of a blue-black storm cloud,
Or like a fine peaked house,
Lovely, resounding with the trumpeting of elephants:
These rocky crags delight me!</p><p>The rain comes down on the lovely flats,
In the mountains frequented by sages.
Echoing with the cries of peacocks,
These rocky crags delight me!</p><p>It’s enough for me,
Desiring to practice jhāna, resolute and mindful.
It’s enough for me,
A resolute monk, desiring the goal.</p><p>It’s enough for me,
A resolute monk, desiring ease,
It’s enough for me,
Desiring to practice, resolute and poised.</p><p>Covered with flowers of flax,
Like the sky covered with clouds,
Full of flocks of many diﬀerent birds,
These rocky crags delight me!</p><p>Empty of householders,
Frequented by herds of deer,
Full of flocks of many diﬀerent birds,
These rocky crags delight me!</p><p>The water is clear and the gorges are wide,
Monkeys and deer are all around;
Festooned with dewy moss,
These rocky crags delight me!</p><p>Music played by a five-piece band
Can never make you as happy,
As when, with unified mind,
You rightly discern the Dhamma.</p><p>Don’t get involved in lots of work,
Avoid people, and don’t try to get more requisites.
If you’re eager and greedy for flavours,
You’ll miss the goal that brings such happiness.</p><p>Don’t get involved in lots of work,
Avoid what doesn’t lead to the goal.
The body gets worn out and fatigued,
And when you suﬀer, you won’t find tranquillity.</p><p>You won’t see yourself
By merely reciting words,
Wandering stiﬀ-necked
And thinking, “I’m better.”</p><p>The fool is no better,
But they think they are.
The wise don’t praise
Stiﬀ-minded people.</p><p>Whoever is not aﬀected
By the modes of conceit—
“I am better”, “I am not better”,
“I am worse”, or “I am the same”—</p><p>Poised, with such understanding,
Endowed with virtues,
And devoted to tranquillity of mind:
That is who the wise praise.</p><p>Whoever has no respect
For their companions in spiritual life
Is as far from true Dhamma
As the sky is from the earth.</p><p>Those whose conscience and shame
Are always rightly established,
Thrive in the spiritual life,
For them, there is no rebirth
In any state of existence.</p><p>If a monk who is haughty and fickle,
Wears rags from the rubbish-heap,
Like a monkey in a lion skin,
That doesn’t make him impressive.</p><p>But if they are humble and stable,
Controlled, with faculties restrained,
Then wearing rags
From the rubbish-heap is impressive,
Like a lion in a mountain cave.</p><p>These famous gods
Endowed with psychic powers,
All 10,000 of them,
Belong to the retinue of Brahmā.</p><p>They stand with hands in añjalī,
Honouring Sāriputta,
The general of the Dhamma, the hero,
The great meditator who is endowed with samādhi.</p><p>“Homage to you, thoroughbred among men!
Homage to you, best among men!
We do not even understand
The basis of your jhāna.</p><p>The profound domain of the Buddhas
Is truly amazing.
We do not understand them,
Though we’ve gathered here to split hairs.”</p><p>When he saw the company of gods
Paying homage to Sāriputta—
Who is truly worthy of homage—
Kappina smiled.</p><p>As far as this Buddha-field extends
I am outstanding in ascetic practices.
I have no equal,
Apart from the great sage himself.</p><p>I’ve attended on the teacher
And fulfilled the Buddha’s instructions.
The heavy burden is laid down,
I’ve undone the attachment to being reborn
In any state of existence.</p><p>Like a lotus flower unstained by water,
Gotama the immeasurable is unstained
By robes, lodgings, or food.
He inclines to renunciation,
And has escaped being reborn
In the three states of existence.</p><p>The great sage’s neck
Is the establishment of mindfulness;
Faith is his hands, and wisdom his head.
Having great knowledge,
He always wanders, quenched.</p></article><footer class=book-footer><div class="flex flex-wrap justify-between"><div></div><div></div></div><div class="flex flex-wrap justify-between"><span><a href=/en/theragatha/sujato/chapter-seventeen/chapter-seventeen/ class="flex align-center"><img src=/icons/backward.svg class=book-icon alt=Backward>
