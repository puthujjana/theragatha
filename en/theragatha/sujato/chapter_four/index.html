4.1 Nāgasamāla# There’s a dancer along the highway,
Dancing as the music plays;
She’s adorned with jewellery and all dressed up,
With a garland of flowers
And perfume of sandalwood.
I entered for alms,
And while going along I glanced at her,
Adorned with jewellery and all dressed up,
Like a snare of death laid down.
Then the realization
Came upon me—
The danger became clear,
And I was firmly repulsed.

side,<br>Until the dart of craving is drawn out.</p><p>As I dwell like this,<br>See my energy and striving!<br>I’ve attained the three knowledges,<br>And fulfilled the Buddha’s
