12.1 Sīlava# One should train just in virtue,
For in this world, when virtue is
Cultivated and well-trained,
It provides all success.
Desiring three kinds of happiness—
Praise, prosperity,
And to delight in heaven after passing away—
The wise should protect virtue.
The well-behaved have many friends,
Because of their self-restraint.
But one without virtue, of bad conduct,
Drives away their friends.
A person of bad behavior has
Ill-repute and infamy.
A person of virtue always has
A good reputation, fame, and praise.

still.</p><p>When I had paid respects at the teacher’s feet,<br>I stood to one side,<br>And asked the most excellent of all beings<br>For the going-forth.</p><p>Then the teacher, being sympathetic,<br>And having compassion for the whole world,<br>Said to me, “Come, monk!”<br>That was my full ordination.</p><p>Staying alone in the wilderness,<br>Without laziness,<br>I did what the
