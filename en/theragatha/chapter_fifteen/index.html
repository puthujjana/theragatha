As I heard the Dhamma, so full of flavor.
Dispassion was the Dhamma that was taught,
Without any grasping at all.”

In the circle of this earth;
They disturb one’s thoughts, I believe,
Beautiful, provoking lust.
Just as a rain cloud would settle
The dust blown up by the wind;
So thoughts settle down

phenomena are not-self—<br>When this is seen with understanding,<br>One turns away from suffering:<br>This is the path to purity.</p><p>The senior monk Koṇḍañña, who was awakened<br>Right after the Buddha, is keenly energetic.<br>He has abandoned birth and death,<br>And has perfected the spiritual life.</p><p>There are floods, snares, and strong posts,<br>And a mountain hard to crack;<br>Snapping the posts and snares,<br>Breaking the mountain so hard to break,<br>Crossing over to the far shore,<br>One practicing jhāna is freed from Māra’s bonds.</p><p>A haughty and fickle monk,<br>Relying on bad friends,<br>Sinks down in the great flood,<br>Overcome by a wave.</p><p>But one who is humble and stable,<br>Controlled, with senses restrained,<br>Wise, with good friends,<br>Would put an end to suffering.</p><p>With knobbly knees,<br>Thin, with veins matted on his skin,<br>Eating and drinking in moderation—<br>This person’s spirit is undaunted.</p><p>Pestered by gadflies and mosquitoes<br>In the awesome wilderness;<br>One should mindfully endure,<br>Like an elephant at the head of the battle.</p><p>I don’t long for death;<br>I don’t long for life;<br>I

gold from stone.</p><p>That elephant outshines all,<br>As the Himālaya outshines other mountains.<br>Of all those named “elephant”,<br>He is truly named, and unsurpassed.</p><p>I’ll extol the elephant to you,<br>For he does nothing wrong.<br>The elephant’s front two feet<br>Are gentleness and harmlessness.</p><p>Mindfulness and awareness<br>Are the elephant’s other feet.<br>Faith is the great elephant’s trunk,<br>And equanimity is the white tusks.</p><p>Mindfulness is his neck, his head is understanding—<br>The investigation and reflection on phenomena—<br>His belly is the sacred hearth of the Dhamma,<br>His tail is seclusion.</p><p>Practicing jhāna, delighting in the breath,<br>Serene inside himself.<br>The elephant is serene when walking,<br>The elephant is serene when standing,</p><p>The elephant is serene when lying down,<br>And when sitting, the elephant is serene.<br>The elephant is restrained everywhere:<br>This is the accomplishment of the elephant.</p><p>He

goes,<br>He goes without longing.</p><p>Just as a white lotus,<br>Fragrant and delightful,<br>Is born in water and grows there,<br>But the water does not stick to it;</p><p>So the Buddha is born in the world,<br>And lives in the world,<br>But the world does not stick to him,<br>As the water does not stick to the lotus.</p><p>A great blazing fire<br>Dies down when the fuel runs out;<br>When the coals have gone out<br>It’s said to be “quenched”.</p><p>This simile is taught by the discerning<br>To express the meaning clearly.<br>Great elephants will understand<br>What the elephant taught the elephant.</p><p>Free of desire, free of hatred,<br>Free of delusion, without defilements,<br>The elephant, abandoning their body,<br>Realises nibbāna without defilements.</p></article><footer
