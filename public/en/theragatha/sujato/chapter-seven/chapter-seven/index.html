7.1 Sundarasamudda# She was adorned with jewellery and all dressed up,
With a garland of flowers
And perfume of sandalwood,
Her feet brightly rouged:
A courtesan wearing slippers.
She took off her slippers in front of me,
Her hands in añjalī,
And softly and sweetly
She spoke to me, smiling:
“You’re too young to have gone forth;
Come, stay in my teaching!
Enjoy human sensual pleasures,
I’ll give you riches.
I promise this is the truth—
I’ll swear by the Sacred Flame.

<h2 id="71-sundarasamudda">7.1 Sundarasamudda<a class="anchor" href="#71-sundarasamudda">#</a></h2>
<p>She was adorned with jewellery and all dressed up,<br>
With a garland of flowers<br>
And perfume of sandalwood,<br>
Her feet brightly rouged:<br>
A courtesan wearing slippers.</p>
<p>She took off her slippers in front of me,<br>
Her hands in añjalī,<br>
And softly and sweetly<br>
She spoke to me, smiling:</p>
<p>“You’re too young to have gone forth;<br>
Come, stay in my teaching!<br>
Enjoy human sensual pleasures,<br>
I’ll give you riches.<br>
I promise this is the truth—<br>
I’ll swear by the Sacred Flame.</p>
<p>And when we’ve grown old together,<br>
Leaning on sticks,<br>
We’ll both go forth,<br>
So we’ll win both ways.”</p>
<p>When I saw the courtesan seducing me,<br>
Her hands in añjalī,<br>
Adorned with jewellery and all dressed up,<br>
Like a snare of death laid down.</p>
<p>Then the realization<br>
Came upon me—<br>
The danger became clear,<br>
And I was firmly repulsed.</p>
<p>Then my mind was liberated—<br>
See the excellence of the Dhamma!<br>
I’ve attained the three knowledges,<br>
And fulfilled the Buddha’s instructions.</p>
<h2 id="72-lakuṇḍakabhaddiya">7.2 Lakuṇḍakabhaddiya<a class="anchor" href="#72-laku%e1%b9%87%e1%b8%8dakabhaddiya">#</a></h2>
<p>Bhaddiya has plucked out craving, root and all,<br>
And in a jungle thicket<br>
On the far side of Ambāṭaka park,<br>
He practices jhāna; he is truly well-favoured.</p>
<p>Some delight in drums,<br>
In lutes, and in cymbals;<br>
But here, at the foot of a tree,<br>
I delight in the Buddha’s teaching.</p>
<p>If the Buddha were to grant me one wish,<br>
And I were to get what I wished for,<br>
I’d choose that the whole world<br>
Be always mindful of the body.</p>
<p>Those who’ve judged me by my appearance,<br>
And those who’ve followed me because of my voice,<br>
They’re under the sway of desire and lust;<br>
They don’t know me.</p>
<p>Not knowing what’s inside,<br>
Not seeing what’s outside;<br>
The fool, obstructed all around,<br>
Is carried away by my voice.</p>
<p>Not knowing what’s inside,<br>
But discerning what’s outside;<br>
They too, seeing only the external fruits of practice,<br>
Are carried away by my voice.</p>
<p>Understanding what’s inside,<br>
And discerning what’s outside;<br>
They, seeing without obstacles,<br>
Are not carried away by my voice.</p>
<h2 id="73-bhadda">7.3 Bhadda<a class="anchor" href="#73-bhadda">#</a></h2>
<p>I was an only child,<br>
Loved by my mother and father.<br>
They had me by practising<br>
Many prayers and observances.</p>
<p>Out of compassion,<br>
Wishing me well and seeking my welfare,<br>
My mother and father<br>
Took me up to the Buddha.</p>
<p>“We had this son with difficulty;<br>
He is delicate, and has grown up in comfort.<br>
We offer him to you, Lord,<br>
To attend upon the conqueror.”</p>
<p>The teacher, having accepted me,<br>
Declared to Ānanda:<br>
“Quickly give him the going-forth—<br>
This one will be a thoroughbred.”</p>
<p>After he, the teacher, had sent me forth,<br>
The conqueror entered his dwelling.<br>
Before the sun set,<br>
My mind was liberated.</p>
<p>The teacher didn’t neglect me;<br>
When he came out from seclusion,<br>
He said: “Come Bhadda!”<br>
That was my full ordination.</p>
<p>At seven years old<br>
I received full ordination.<br>
I’ve attained the three knowledges;<br>
Oh, the excellence of the Dhamma!</p>
<h2 id="74-sopāka">7.4 Sopāka<a class="anchor" href="#74-sop%c4%81ka">#</a></h2>
<p>I saw the most excellent person,<br>
Walking meditation in the shade of the terrace,<br>
So I approached,<br>
And bowed to the most excellent man.</p>
<p>Arranging my robe over one shoulder,<br>
And clasping my hands together,<br>
I walked meditation alongside that stainless one,<br>
Most excellent of all beings.</p>
<p>The wise one, skilled in questions,<br>
Questioned me.<br>
Brave and fearless,<br>
I answered the teacher.</p>
<p>When all his questions were answered,<br>
The Tathāgata congratulated me.<br>
Looking around the monastic Saṅgha,<br>
He said this:</p>
<p>“It is a blessing for the people of Aṅga and Magadha<br>
That this person enjoys their<br>
Robe and almsfood,<br>
Requisites and lodgings,<br>
Their respect and service—<br>
It’s a blessing for them,” he declared.</p>
<p>“Sopāka, from this day on<br>
You are invited to come and see me.<br>
And Sopāka, let this<br>
Be your full ordination.”</p>
<p>At seven years old<br>
I received full ordination.<br>
I bear my final body—<br>
Oh, the excellence of the Dhamma!</p>
<h2 id="75-sarabhaṅga">7.5 Sarabhaṅga<a class="anchor" href="#75-sarabha%e1%b9%85ga">#</a></h2>
<p>I broke the reeds off with my hands,<br>
Made a hut, and stayed there.<br>
So I became known as “Reed-breaker”.</p>
<p>But now it’s not appropriate<br>
For me to break reeds with my hands.<br>
The training rules have been laid down for us<br>
By Gotama the renowned.</p>
<p>Previously, I, Sarabhaṅga,<br>
Didn’t see the disease in its entirety.<br>
But now I have seen the disease,<br>
Because I practised what was taught<br>
By the one beyond the gods.</p>
<p>Gotama travelled by that straight road;<br>
The same path travelled by Vipassī,<br>
The same path as Sikhī, Vessabhū,<br>
Kakusandha, Koṇāgamana, and Kassapa.</p>
<p>By these seven Buddhas,<br>
Who plunged into the ending,<br>
Free of craving, without grasping,<br>
Having become Dhamma, poised,<br>
This Dhamma was taught,</p>
<p>Out of compassion for living beings—<br>
Suffering, origin, path,<br>
And cessation, the ending of suffering.</p>
<p>In these four noble truths,<br>
Suffering is stopped,<br>
This endless transmigration.<br>
When the body has broken up,<br>
And life has come to an end,<br>
There is no more rebirth into any state of existence:<br>
I’m well-liberated in every way.</p>
