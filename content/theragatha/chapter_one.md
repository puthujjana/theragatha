# Chapter One

## 1.1 Subhūti
My little hut is roofed and pleasant,  
Sheltered from the wind:  
So rain, sky, as you please!  
My mind is serene and freed,  
I practice whole-heartedly: so rain, sky!  

## 1.2 Mahākoṭṭhika
Calm and quiet,
Wise in counsel and steady;
Shaking off bad qualities,
As the wind shakes leaves off a tree.

## 1.3 Kaṅkhārevata
See this wisdom of the Tathāgatas!
Like a fire blazing in the night,
Giving light, giving vision,
Dispelling the doubt of those who’ve come here.

## 1.4 Puṇṇa
You should only associate with the wise,
Those intent upon good, seeing the goal.
Being wise, heedful, and discerning,
They realise the goal, so great, profound,
Hard to see, subtle, and fine.

## 1.5 Dabba
Once hard to tame, now tamed themselves,
Worthy, content, crossed over doubt.
Victorious, with fears vanished,
Dabba is steadfast, and has realized nibbāna.

## 1.6 Sītavaniya
The monk who went to Sītavana is alone,
Content, practicing samādhi,
Victorious, with goosebumps vanished,
Guarding mindfulness of the body, resolute.

## 1.7 Bhalliya
He has swept away the army of the king of death,
Like a great flood sweeping away
A fragile bridge of reeds.
Victorious, with fears vanished,
He is tamed and steadfast, and has realized nibbāna.

## 1.8 Vīra
Once hard to tame, now tamed himself,
A hero, content, with doubt overcome,
Victorious, with goosebumps vanished,
Vīra is steadfast, and has realized nibbāna.

## 1.9 Pilindavaccha
It was welcome, not unwelcome,
The advice I got was good.
Of things which are shared,
I encountered the best.

## 1.10 Puṇṇamāsa
One who is accomplished in knowledge,
Peaceful and restrained,
Doesn’t expect to dwell in this world or the next.
Without clinging to anything,
They know the arising and passing of the world.

## 1.11 Cūḷavaccha
A monk with much joy
In the Dhamma taught by the Buddha
Would realise the peaceful state:
The stilling of activities, bliss.

## 1.12 Mahāvaccha
Empowered by wisdom,
Endowed with virtue and vows,
Possessing samādhi, delighting in jhāna, mindful,
Eating suitable food,
One should bide one’s time here, free of desire.

## 1.13 Vanavaccha
They look like blue-black storm clouds, glistening,
Cooled with the waters of clear-flowing streams,
And covered with ladybird beetles:
These rocky crags delight me!

## 1.14 Novice Sivaka
My preceptor said:
“Let’s go from here, Sīvaka.”
My body lives in the village,
But my mind has gone to the wilderness.
I’ll go there even if I’m lying down;
There’s no tying down one who understands.

## 1.15 Kuṇḍadhāna
Five should be cut off, five should be abandoned,
Five more should be developed.
A monk who has overcome five attachments
Is called “One who has crossed the flood”.

## 1.16 Belaṭṭhasīsa
Just as a fine thoroughbred
Proceeds with ease,
Tail and mane flying in the wind;
So my days and nights
Proceed with ease,
Full of spiritual joy.

## 1.17 Dāsaka
One who is drowsy, a glutton,
Fond of sleep, rolling as they lie,
Like a great hog stuffed with food:
That fool is reborn again and again.

## 1.18 Siṅgālapitu
There was an heir of the Buddha,
A monk in Bhesakaḷā forest,
Who suffused the entire earth
With the perception of “bones”.
I think he will quickly abandon sensual desire.

## 1.19 Kula
Irrigators lead water,
Fletchers shape arrows,
Carpenters shape wood;
The disciplined tame themselves.

## 1.20 Ajita
I do not fear death;
Nor do I long for life.
I’ll lay down this body,
Aware and mindful.

## 1.21 Nigrodha
I’m not afraid of fear.
Our teacher is skilled in the deathless;
Monks proceed by the path
Where no fear remains.

## 1.22 Cittaka
Crested peacocks with beautiful blue necks
Cry out in Karaṃvī.
Aroused by a cool breeze,
They awaken the sleeper to practice jhāna.

## 1.23 Gosāla
I’ll eat honey and rice in Veḷugumba,
And then, skilfully scrutinizing
The rise and fall of the aggregates,
I’ll return to my forest hill,
And devote myself to seclusion.

## 1.24 Sugandha
I went forth after the rainy season—
See the excellence of the Dhamma!
I’ve attained the three knowledges
And fulfilled the Buddha’s instructions.

## 1.25 Nandiya
Dark One, if you attack such a monk,
Whose mind is full of light,
And has arrived at the fruit,
You’ll fall into suffering.

## 1.26 Abhaya
Having heard the wonderful words
Of the Buddha, the Kinsman of the Sun,
I penetrated the subtle truth,
Like a hair-tip with an arrow.

## 1.27 Lomasakaṅgiya
With my chest I’ll thrust aside
The grasses, vines, and creepers,
And devote myself to seclusion.

## 1.28 Jambugāmikaputta
Aren’t you obsessed with clothes?
Don’t you delight in jewellery?
Is it you—not anyone else—
Spreading the scent of virtue?

## 1.29 Hārita
Straighten yourself,
Like a fletcher straightens an arrow.
When your mind is upright, Hārita,
Demolish ignorance!

## 1.30 Uttiya
When I was ill in the past,
I was mindful.
Now I am ill once more—
It’s time to be heedful.

## 1.31 Gahvaratīriya
Bitten by ticks and mosquitoes
In the wilderness, the ancient forest;
One should endure mindfully,
Like an elephant at the head of the battle.

## 1.32 Suppiya
I’ll exchange old age for the un-ageing,
Burning for extinguishing:
The ultimate peace,
The unexcelled safety from the yoke.

## 1.33 Sopāka
Just as a mother would be good
To her beloved and only son;
So, to creatures all and everywhere,
Let one be good.

## 1.34 Posiya
For one who understands
It’s always better not to mix with such women.
I went from the village to the wilderness;
From there I entered the house.
Though I was there to be fed,
I stood up and left without taking leave.

## 1.35 Sāmaññakāni
Whoever is seeking happiness
Will find it through this practice,
Get a good reputation, and grow in renown:
Develop the noble eightfold, straight, direct path
For the realisation of the deathless.

## 1.36 Kumāputta
Learning is good, wandering is good,
Homeless life is always good.
Questions on the goal,
Actions that are skilful,
This is the ascetic life for one who has nothing.

## 1.37 Kumāputtasahāyaka
Some travel to different regions,
Wandering unrestrained.
If they lose their stillness,
What is the point
Of wandering around the countries?
So you should dispel pride,
Practising jhāna without distraction.

## 1.38 Gavampati
His psychic power
Made the river Sarabhu stand still;
Gavampati is unbound and unperturbed.
The gods bow to that great sage,
Who has left behind all attachments,
And gone beyond rebirth in any state of existence.

## 1.39 Tissa
As if struck by a sword,
As if their head was on fire,
A monk should go forth mindfully,
To abandon desire for sensual pleasures.

## 1.40 Vaḍḍhamāna
As if struck by a sword,
As if their head was on fire,
A monk should go forth mindfully,
To abandon desire to be reborn
In any state of existence.

## 1.41 Sirivaḍḍha
Lightning flashes down
On the cleft of Vebhāra and Paṇḍava.
But in the mountain cleft, the son of the inimitable
Is absorbed in jhāna, equanimous.

## 1.42 Khadiravaniya
Cāla, Upacāla and Sīsupacāla:
Be mindful!
I’ve come to you like a hair-splitter.

## 1.43 Sumaṅgala
Well freed! Well freed!
I’m very well freed from three crooked things:
My sickles, my ploughs, my little hoes.
Even if they were here, right here—
I’d be done with them, done!
Practice jhāna Sumaṅgala!
Practice jhāna Sumaṅgala!
Stay heedful, Sumaṅgala!

## 1.44 Sānu
Mum, they cry for the dead,
Or for one who is alive but has disappeared.
I’m alive and you can see me,
So Mum, why do you weep for me?

## 1.45 Ramaṇīyavihāri
Just as an excellent thoroughbred
Having stumbled, stands firm,
So I’m endowed with vision,
A disciple of the Buddha.

## 1.46 Samiddhi
I went forth out of faith
From the home life into homelessness.
My mindfulness and wisdom have grown,
My mind is serene in samādhi.
Make whatever illusions you want,
It doesn’t bother me.

## 1.47 Ujjaya
Homage to the Buddha, the hero,
Freed in every way.
Abiding in the fruits of your practice,
I live without defilements.

## 1.48 Sañjaya
Since I’ve gone forth
From home life into homelessness,
I’m not aware of any intention
That is ignoble and hateful.

## 1.49 Rāmaṇeyyaka
Even with all the sounds,
The sweet chirping and cheeping of birds,
My mind doesn’t tremble,
For I’m devoted to oneness.

## 1.50 Vimala
The rain falls and the wind blows on mother Earth,
While lightning flashes across the sky!
But my thoughts are stilled,
My mind is serene in samādhi.

## 1.51 Godhika
The sky rains down, like a beautiful song,
My little hut is roofed and pleasant,
Sheltered from the wind.
My mind is serene in samādhi:
So rain, sky, as you please.

## 1.52 Subāhu
The sky rains down, like a beautiful song,
My little hut is roofed and pleasant,
Sheltered from the wind.
My mind is serene in my body:
So rain, sky, as you please.

## 1.53 Valliya
The sky rains down, like a beautiful song,
My little hut is roofed and pleasant,
Sheltered from the wind.
I dwell there, heedful:
So rain, sky, as you please.

## 1.54 Uttiya
The sky rains down, like a beautiful song,
My little hut is roofed and pleasant,
Sheltered from the wind.
I dwell there without a partner:
So rain, sky, as you please.

## 1.55 Añjanavaniya
I plunged into the Añjana forest
And made a little hut to live in.
I’ve attained the three knowledges
And fulfilled the Buddha’s instructions.

## 1.56 Kuṭivihāri
“Who is in this little hut?”
“A monk is in this little hut,
Free of lust, his mind serene in samādhi.
My friend, you should know this:
Your little hut wasn’t built in vain.”

## 1.57 Dutiyakuṭivihāri
This was your old hut,
But you still want a new hut.
Dispel desire for a hut, monk!
A new hut will only bring more suffering.

## 1.58 Ramaṇīyakuṭika
My little hut is pleasing, delightful,
A gift given in faith.
I’ve no need of girls:
Go, ladies, to those in need!

## 1.59 Kosalavihāri
I went forth out of faith
And built a little hut in the wilderness.
I’m heedful, ardent,
Aware, and mindful.

## 1.60 Sīvali
My intentions, the purpose
Of entering this hut, have prospered.
Abandoning the tendency to conceit,
I’ll realise knowledge and liberation.

## 1.61 Vappa
One who sees
Sees those who see and those who don’t.
One who doesn’t see
Sees neither.

## 1.62 Vajjiputta
We dwell alone in the wilderness,
Like a log rejected in a forest.
Lots of people are jealous of me,
Like beings in hell are jealous
Of someone going to heaven.

## 1.63 Pakkha
They died and fell;
Fallen but still greedy, they return.
What had to be done has been done,
What had to be enjoyed has been enjoyed,
Happiness has been realised through happiness.

## 1.64 Vimalakoṇḍañña
I arose from the one named after a tree,
I was born of the one whose banner shines.
The banner killer has destroyed the great banner,
By means of the banner itself.

## 1.65 Ukkhepakatavaccha
Vaccha has tossed away
What he built over many years.
Sitting comfortably, uplifted with joy,
He teaches this to householders.

## 1.66 Meghiya
He counselled me, the great hero,
The one who has gone beyond all things.
When I heard his teaching
I stayed close by him, mindful.
I’ve attained the three knowledges
And fulfilled the Buddha’s instructions.

## 1.67 Ekadhammasavanīya
My defilements have been burnt away
By practising jhāna;
Rebirth into all states of existence is over,
Transmigration through births is finished.

## 1.68 Ekudāniya
A sage with higher consciousness, heedful,
Training in the ways of silence,
At peace and always mindful:
Such a one has no sorrow.

## 1.69 Channa
Hearing the sweet Dhamma taught by the master,
Who understands all, and whose knowledge excels,
I’ve entered the path to realise the deathless.
He’s skilled in the road to safety from the yoke.

## 1.70 Puṇṇa
Virtue is the highest here,
But understanding is supreme.
A person with both virtue and understanding
Is victorious among men and gods.

## 1.71 Vacchapāla
Though nibbāna is very refined and subtle,
It is not difficult to realize for one who sees the goal,
Skilled in thought, humble in manner,
Cultivating the virtuous conduct of the Buddha.

## 1.72 Ātuma
A young bamboo is hard to trample
When the point is grown and it’s become woody;
That’s how I feel with the wife
Who was arranged for me.
Give me permission—now I’ve gone forth.

## 1.73 Māṇava
Seeing an old person,
One suffering from disease,
And a corpse, come to the end of life,
I went forth, becoming a wanderer,
And abandoning the pleasures of the senses.

## 1.74 Suyāmana
Sensual desire, ill will,
Dullness and drowsiness,
Restlessness, and doubt
Are not found in a monk at all.

## 1.75 Susārada
Good is the sight of those who’ve practised well;
Doubt is cut off, and intelligence grows.
Even a fool becomes wise;
Therefore meeting with such people is good.

## 1.76 Piyañjaha
Settle down when others spring up;
Spring up when others settle down;
Remain when others have departed;
Be without delight when others delight.

## 1.77 Hatthārohaputta
In the past my mind wandered
How it wished, where it liked, as it pleased.
Now I’ll carefully guide it,
As a rutting elephant is guided
By a trainer with a hook.

## 1.78 Meṇḍasira
Transmigrating through countless births,
I’ve journeyed without end.
I’ve suffered, but now:
The mass of suffering has collapsed.

## 1.79 Rakkhita
All my lust is abandoned,
All my hate is undone,
All my delusion is gone;
I’m cooled, quenched.

## 1.80 Ugga
Whatever actions I have performed,
Whether trivial or important,
Are all completely exhausted;
Now there is no more rebirth
Into any state of existence.

## 1.81 Samitigutta
Whatever evil I have performed
In previous births,
It is to be experienced right here,
And not in any other place.

## 1.82 Kassapa
Go, child,
Where there’s plenty of food,
Safe and fearless—
May you not be overcome by sorrow!

## 1.83 Sīha
Dwell heedful, Sīha,
Don’t be lazy by day or by night.
Develop skilful qualities,
And quickly discard this mortal frame.

## 1.84 Nīta
Sleeping all night,
Fond of socializing by day,
When will the fool
Make an end of suffering?

## 1.85 Sunāga
Skilled in the characteristics of the mind,
Understanding the sweetness of seclusion,
Practising jhāna, disciplined, mindful:
Such a person would realize spiritual happiness.

## 1.86 Nāgita
Outside of here there are many other doctrines;
Those paths don’t lead to nibbāna, but this one does.
Indeed, the Blessed One himself counsels the Saṅgha;
The Teacher shows the palms of his hands.

## 1.87 Paviṭṭha
The aggregates are seen in accordance with reality,
Rebirth in all states of existence is torn apart,
Transmigration through births is finished,
Now there is no more rebirth
Into any state of existence.

## 1.88 Ajjuna
I was able to lift myself up
From the water to the shore.
I’ve penetrated the truths,
Like one swept along on a powerful flood.

## 1.89 Devasabha
I’ve crossed the marshes,
I’ve avoided the cliffs,
I’m freed from floods and fetters,
And I've destroyed all conceit.

## 1.90 Sāmidatta
The five aggregates are fully understood;
They remain with the root cut off.
Transmigration is finished,
Now there is no more rebirth
Into any state of existence.

## 1.91 Paripuṇṇaka
What I consumed today is considered better
Than pure food of a hundred flavors:
The Dhamma taught by the Buddha,
Gotama of infinite vision.

## 1.92 Vijaya
The one whose defilements are dried up,
Who’s not attached to food,
Whose resort is the liberation
That is signless and empty:
Their track is hard to trace,
Like that of birds in the sky.

## 1.93 Eraka
Sensual pleasures are suffering, Eraka!
Sensual pleasures aren’t happiness, Eraka!
One who enjoys sensual pleasures
Enjoys suffering, Eraka!
One who doesn’t enjoy sensual pleasures
Doesn’t enjoy suffering, Eraka!

## 1.94 Mettaji
Homage to that Blessed One,
The glorious son of the Sakyans!
When he realised the highest state,
He taught the highest Dhamma well.

## 1.95 Cakkhupāla
I’m blind, my eyes are ruined,
I’m travelling a desolate road.
Even if I have to crawl I’ll keep going—
Though not with wicked companions.

## 1.96 Khaṇḍasumana
I offered a single flower,
And then amused myself in heavens
For 800 million years;
With what’s left over I’ve realized nibbāna.

## 1.97 Tissa
Giving up a valuable bronze bowl,
And a precious golden one, too,
I took a bowl made of clay:
This is my second anointing.

## 1.98 Abhaya
If you focus on the pleasant aspect
Of sights that you see, you’ll lose your mindfulness.
Experiencing it with a lustful mind,
You keep holding on.
Your defilements grow,
Leading to the root of rebirth
In some state of existence.

## 1.99 Uttiya
If you focus on the pleasant aspect
Of sounds that you hear,
You’ll lose your mindfulness.
Experiencing it with a lustful mind,
You keep holding on.
Your defilements grow,
Leading to transmigration.

## 1.100 Devasabha
Accomplished in the four right strivings,
With establishment of mindfulness as your safe place,
Festooned with the flowers of liberation,
You’ll realise nibbāna without defilements.

## 1.101 Belaṭṭhānika
He’s given up the household life,
But he has no purpose,
Like a big pig that chomps on grain,
Using his snout as a plough, living for his belly, lazy:
That idiot comes to the womb again and again.

## 1.102 Setuccha
Deceived by conceit,
Defiled by conditions,
Distressed by gain and loss,
They don’t realise samādhi.

## 1.103 Bandhura
I don’t need this—
I’m satisfied and pleased with the sweet Dhamma.
I’ve drunk the best, the supreme nectar:
I won’t go near poison.

## 1.104 Khitaka
Hey! My body is light,
Full of so much rapture and happiness.
My body feels like it’s floating,
Like cotton on the wind.

## 1.105 Malitavambha
Dissatisfied, one should not stay;
Happy, one should depart.
One who sees clearly wouldn’t stay
In a place that was not conducive to the goal.

## 1.106 Suhemanta
When the meaning has a hundred aspects,
And carries a hundred characteristics,
The fool sees only one factor,
While the sage sees a hundred.

## 1.107 Dhammasava
After investigating, I went forth
From the home life into homelessness.
I’ve attained the three knowledges
And fulfilled the Buddha’s instructions.

## 1.108 Dhammasavapitu
At 120 years old
I went forth into homelessness.
I’ve attained the three knowledges
And fulfilled the Buddha’s instructions.

## 1.109 Saṃgharakkhita
He’s gone on retreat,
But he doesn’t yet heed the counsel
Of the one with supreme compassion
For his welfare.
He lives with unrestrained faculties,
Like a young deer in the woods.

## 1.110 Usabha
The trees on the mountain-tops have grown well,
Freshly sprinkled by towering clouds.
For Usabha, who loves seclusion,
And who thinks only of wilderness,
Goodness arises more and more.

## 1.111 Jenta
Going forth is hard, living at home is hard,
Dhamma is profound,
And money is hard to come by.
Getting by is difficult
For we who accept whatever comes,
So we should always remember impermanence.

## 1.112 Vacchagotta
I have the three knowledges, I’m a great meditator,
Skilled in serenity of mind.
I’ve realized my own true goal,
And fulfilled the Buddha’s instructions.

## 1.113 Vanavaccha
The water is clear and the gorges are wide,
Monkeys and deer are all around;
Festooned with dewy moss,
These rocky crags delight me!

## 1.114 Adhimutta
When your body is uncomfortably heavy,
While life is running out;
Greedy for physical pleasure,
How can you find happiness as an ascetic?

## 1.115 Mahānāma
By Mount Nesādaka,
With its famous covering
Of many shrubs and trees,
You’re found deficient.

## 1.116 Pārāpariya
I’ve abandoned the six spheres of sense-contact,
My sense-doors are guarded and well restrained;
I’ve ejected the root of misery,
And attained the end of defilements.

## 1.117 Yasa
I’m well-anointed and well-dressed,
Adorned with all my jewellery.
I’ve attained the three knowledges
And fulfilled the Buddha’s instructions.

## 1.118 Kimila
Old age falls like a curse;
It’s the same body, but it seems like someone else’s.
I remember myself as if I was someone else,
But I’m still the same, I haven’t been away.

## 1.119 Vajjiputta
You’ve gone to the jungle, the root of a tree,
Putting nibbāna in your heart.
Practice jhāna, Gotama, don’t be heedless.
What is this hullabaloo to you?

## 1.120 Isidatta
The five aggregates are fully understood,
They remain, but their root is severed.
I have realized the end of suffering,
And attained the end of defilements.
