# Chapter Fourteen

*Translated by Bhikkhu Sujato.*

## 14.1 Khadiravaniyarevata  

Since I’ve gone forth  
From home life into homelessness,  
I’m not aware of any intention  
That is ignoble and hateful.  

“May these beings be killed!  
May they be slaughtered!  
May they suffer!”—  
I’m not aware of having any such intentions  
In all this long period of time.  

I have been aware of loving-kindness,  
Measureless and well-developed,  
Gradually built up,  
Just as the Buddha taught.  

I’m friend and comrade to all,  
Compassionate to all beings,  
Developing a mind of loving-kindness,  
And always delighting in harmlessness.  

Immovable, unshakable,  
I gladden the mind.  
I develop the sublime abidings,  
Which bad men do not cultivate.  

Having entered a meditation state without thought,  
A disciple of the Buddha  
Is at that moment blessed  
With noble silence.  

Just like a rocky mountain  
Is unshakable and firmly grounded;  
So when delusion ends,  
A monk, like a mountain, doesn’t tremble.  

To the blameless man  
Who is always seeking purity,  
Even a hair-tip of evil  
Seems the size of a cloud.  

Just like a frontier city,  
Is guarded inside and out,  
So you should ward yourselves—  
Don’t let the moment pass you by.  

I don’t long for death;  
I don’t long for life;  
I await my time,  
Like a worker waiting for their wages.  

I don’t long for death;  
I don’t long for life;  
I await my time,  
Aware and mindful.  

I’ve attended on the teacher  
And fulfilled the Buddha’s instructions.  
The heavy burden is laid down,  
I’ve undone the attachment to being reborn  
In any state of existence.  

I’ve attained the goal  
For the sake of which I went forth  
From home life into homelessness—  
The ending of all fetters.  

Strive on with heedfulness:  
This is my advice.  
Come, I’ll realise nibbāna—  
I’m liberated in every way.  

## 14.2 Godatta  

Just as a fine thoroughbred,  
Yoked to a carriage, endures the load,  
Oppressed by the heavy burden,  
And yet doesn’t try to escape the yoke;  

So too, those who are as filled with understanding  
As the ocean is with water,  
Don’t look down on others;  
This is the noble Dhamma regarding living beings.  

People who fall under the dominion of time,  
Under the dominion of being reborn  
In one state of existence after another,  
Undergo suffering,  
And those young men grieve in this life.  

Elated by anything happy,  
Downcast by anything suffering:  
These both destroy the fool,  
Who doesn’t see in accordance with reality.  

But those who in suffering and in happiness,  
And in the middle have overcome the weaver;  
They stand like a royal pillar,  
Neither elated nor downcast.  

Not to gain or loss,  
Not to fame or reputation,  
Not to criticism or praise,  
Not to suffering or happiness—  

The wise cling to nothing,  
Like a droplet on a lotus-leaf.  
They are happy everywhere,  
And unconquered everywhere.  

There’s principled loss,  
And there’s unprincipled gain.  
Principled loss is better  
Than unprincipled gain.  

There’s the fame of the unintelligent,  
And there’s the disrepute of the discerning.  
Disrepute of the discerning is better  
Than the fame of the unintelligent.  

There’s praise by fools,  
And there’s criticism by the discerning.  
Criticism by the discerning is better  
Than praise by fools.  

There’s the happiness of sensual pleasures,  
And there’s the suffering of seclusion.  
The suffering of seclusion is better  
Than the happiness of sensual pleasures.  

There’s life without principles,  
And there’s death with principles.  
Death with principles is better  
Than life without principles.  

Those who have abandoned  
Sensual pleasures and anger,  
Their minds at peace regarding being reborn  
In one state of existence or another,  
They wander in the world unattached,  
For them nothing is beloved or unloved.  

Having developed the factors of awakening,  
The spiritual faculties, and the powers,  
I’ve attained ultimate peace:  
Nibbāna without defilements.
