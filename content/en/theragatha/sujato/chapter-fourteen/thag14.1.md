## 14.1 Khadiravaniyarevata  


Since I’ve gone forth  
From home life into homelessness,  
I’m not aware of any intention  
That is ignoble and hateful.  

“May these beings be killed!  
May they be slaughtered!  
May they suffer!”—  
I’m not aware of having any such intentions  
In all this long period of time.  

I have been aware of loving-kindness,  
Measureless and well-developed,  
Gradually built up,  
Just as the Buddha taught.  

I’m friend and comrade to all,  
Compassionate to all beings,  
Developing a mind of loving-kindness,  
And always delighting in harmlessness.  

Immovable, unshakable,  
I gladden the mind.  
I develop the sublime abidings,  
Which bad men do not cultivate.  

Having entered a meditation state without thought,  
A disciple of the Buddha  
Is at that moment blessed  
With noble silence.  

Just like a rocky mountain  
Is unshakable and firmly grounded;  
So when delusion ends,  
A monk, like a mountain, doesn’t tremble.  

To the blameless man  
Who is always seeking purity,  
Even a hair-tip of evil  
Seems the size of a cloud.  

Just like a frontier city,  
Is guarded inside and out,  
So you should ward yourselves—  
Don’t let the moment pass you by.  

I don’t long for death;  
I don’t long for life;  
I await my time,  
Like a worker waiting for their wages.  

I don’t long for death;  
I don’t long for life;  
I await my time,  
Aware and mindful.  

I’ve attended on the teacher  
And fulfilled the Buddha’s instructions.  
The heavy burden is laid down,  
I’ve undone the attachment to being reborn  
In any state of existence.  

I’ve attained the goal  
For the sake of which I went forth  
From home life into homelessness—  
The ending of all fetters.  

Strive on with heedfulness:  
This is my advice.  
Come, I’ll realise nibbāna—  
I’m liberated in every way.
