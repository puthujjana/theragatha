## 6.2 Tekicchakāri  


“The rice has been harvested,  
And gathered on the threshing-floor—  
But I don’t get any alms-food!  
How will I get by?”  

“Recollect the immeasurable Buddha!  
Confident, your body pervaded with rapture,  
You’ll always be full of joy.  

Recollect the immeasurable Dhamma!  
Confident, your body pervaded with rapture,  
You’ll always be full of joy.  

Recollect the immeasurable Saṅgha!  
Confident, your body pervaded with rapture,  
You’ll always be full of joy.”  

“You stay in the open,  
Though these winter nights are cold.  

Don’t perish, overcome with cold;  
Enter your dwelling, with its door shut fast.”  

“I’ll realise the four immeasurable states,  
And dwell happily with them.  
I won’t perish, overcome with cold;  
I’ll dwell unperturbed.”
