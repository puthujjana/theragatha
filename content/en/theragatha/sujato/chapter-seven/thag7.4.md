## 7.4 Sopāka  


I saw the most excellent person,  
Walking meditation in the shade of the terrace,  
So I approached,  
And bowed to the most excellent man.  

Arranging my robe over one shoulder,  
And clasping my hands together,  
I walked meditation alongside that stainless one,  
Most excellent of all beings.  

The wise one, skilled in questions,  
Questioned me.  
Brave and fearless,  
I answered the teacher.  

When all his questions were answered,  
The Tathāgata congratulated me.  
Looking around the monastic Saṅgha,  
He said this:  

“It is a blessing for the people of Aṅga and Magadha  
That this person enjoys their  
Robe and almsfood,  
Requisites and lodgings,  
Their respect and service—  
It’s a blessing for them,” he declared.  

“Sopāka, from this day on  
You are invited to come and see me.  
And Sopāka, let this  
Be your full ordination.”  

At seven years old  
I received full ordination.  
I bear my final body—  
Oh, the excellence of the Dhamma!
