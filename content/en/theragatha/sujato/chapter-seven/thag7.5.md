## 7.5 Sarabhaṅga  


I broke the reeds off with my hands,  
Made a hut, and stayed there.  
So I became known as “Reed-breaker”.  

But now it’s not appropriate  
For me to break reeds with my hands.  
The training rules have been laid down for us  
By Gotama the renowned.  

Previously, I, Sarabhaṅga,  
Didn’t see the disease in its entirety.  
But now I have seen the disease,  
Because I practised what was taught  
By the one beyond the gods.  

Gotama travelled by that straight road;  
The same path travelled by Vipassī,  
The same path as Sikhī, Vessabhū,  
Kakusandha, Koṇāgamana, and Kassapa.  

By these seven Buddhas,  
Who plunged into the ending,  
Free of craving, without grasping,  
Having become Dhamma, poised,  
This Dhamma was taught,  

Out of compassion for living beings—  
Suffering, origin, path,  
And cessation, the ending of suffering.  

In these four noble truths,  
Suffering is stopped,  
This endless transmigration.  
When the body has broken up,  
And life has come to an end,  
There is no more rebirth into any state of existence:  
I’m well-liberated in every way.
