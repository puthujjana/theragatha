## 7.1 Sundarasamudda  


She was adorned with jewellery and all dressed up,  
With a garland of flowers  
And perfume of sandalwood,  
Her feet brightly rouged:  
A courtesan wearing slippers.  

She took off her slippers in front of me,  
Her hands in añjalī,  
And softly and sweetly  
She spoke to me, smiling:  

“You’re too young to have gone forth;  
Come, stay in my teaching!  
Enjoy human sensual pleasures,  
I’ll give you riches.  
I promise this is the truth—  
I’ll swear by the Sacred Flame.  

And when we’ve grown old together,  
Leaning on sticks,  
We’ll both go forth,  
So we’ll win both ways.”  

When I saw the courtesan seducing me,  
Her hands in añjalī,  
Adorned with jewellery and all dressed up,  
Like a snare of death laid down.  

Then the realization  
Came upon me—  
The danger became clear,  
And I was firmly repulsed.  

Then my mind was liberated—  
See the excellence of the Dhamma!  
I’ve attained the three knowledges,  
And fulfilled the Buddha’s instructions.
