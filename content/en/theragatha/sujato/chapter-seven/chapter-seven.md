# Chapter Seven

*Translated by Bhikkhu Sujato.*

## 7.1 Sundarasamudda  

She was adorned with jewellery and all dressed up,  
With a garland of flowers  
And perfume of sandalwood,  
Her feet brightly rouged:  
A courtesan wearing slippers.  

She took off her slippers in front of me,  
Her hands in añjalī,  
And softly and sweetly  
She spoke to me, smiling:  

“You’re too young to have gone forth;  
Come, stay in my teaching!  
Enjoy human sensual pleasures,  
I’ll give you riches.  
I promise this is the truth—  
I’ll swear by the Sacred Flame.  

And when we’ve grown old together,  
Leaning on sticks,  
We’ll both go forth,  
So we’ll win both ways.”  

When I saw the courtesan seducing me,  
Her hands in añjalī,  
Adorned with jewellery and all dressed up,  
Like a snare of death laid down.  

Then the realization  
Came upon me—  
The danger became clear,  
And I was firmly repulsed.  

Then my mind was liberated—  
See the excellence of the Dhamma!  
I’ve attained the three knowledges,  
And fulfilled the Buddha’s instructions.  


## 7.2 Lakuṇḍakabhaddiya  

Bhaddiya has plucked out craving, root and all,  
And in a jungle thicket  
On the far side of Ambāṭaka park,  
He practices jhāna; he is truly well-favoured.  

Some delight in drums,  
In lutes, and in cymbals;  
But here, at the foot of a tree,  
I delight in the Buddha’s teaching.  

If the Buddha were to grant me one wish,  
And I were to get what I wished for,  
I’d choose that the whole world  
Be always mindful of the body.  

Those who’ve judged me by my appearance,  
And those who’ve followed me because of my voice,  
They’re under the sway of desire and lust;  
They don’t know me.  

Not knowing what’s inside,  
Not seeing what’s outside;  
The fool, obstructed all around,  
Is carried away by my voice.  

Not knowing what’s inside,  
But discerning what’s outside;  
They too, seeing only the external fruits of practice,  
Are carried away by my voice.  

Understanding what’s inside,  
And discerning what’s outside;  
They, seeing without obstacles,  
Are not carried away by my voice.  


## 7.3 Bhadda  

I was an only child,  
Loved by my mother and father.  
They had me by practising  
Many prayers and observances.  

Out of compassion,  
Wishing me well and seeking my welfare,  
My mother and father  
Took me up to the Buddha.  

“We had this son with difficulty;  
He is delicate, and has grown up in comfort.  
We offer him to you, Lord,  
To attend upon the conqueror.”  

The teacher, having accepted me,  
Declared to Ānanda:  
“Quickly give him the going-forth—  
This one will be a thoroughbred.”  

After he, the teacher, had sent me forth,  
The conqueror entered his dwelling.  
Before the sun set,  
My mind was liberated.  

The teacher didn’t neglect me;  
When he came out from seclusion,  
He said: “Come Bhadda!”  
That was my full ordination.  

At seven years old  
I received full ordination.  
I’ve attained the three knowledges;  
Oh, the excellence of the Dhamma!  


## 7.4 Sopāka  

I saw the most excellent person,  
Walking meditation in the shade of the terrace,  
So I approached,  
And bowed to the most excellent man.  

Arranging my robe over one shoulder,  
And clasping my hands together,  
I walked meditation alongside that stainless one,  
Most excellent of all beings.  

The wise one, skilled in questions,  
Questioned me.  
Brave and fearless,  
I answered the teacher.  

When all his questions were answered,  
The Tathāgata congratulated me.  
Looking around the monastic Saṅgha,  
He said this:  

“It is a blessing for the people of Aṅga and Magadha  
That this person enjoys their  
Robe and almsfood,  
Requisites and lodgings,  
Their respect and service—  
It’s a blessing for them,” he declared.  

“Sopāka, from this day on  
You are invited to come and see me.  
And Sopāka, let this  
Be your full ordination.”  

At seven years old  
I received full ordination.  
I bear my final body—  
Oh, the excellence of the Dhamma!  


## 7.5 Sarabhaṅga  

I broke the reeds off with my hands,  
Made a hut, and stayed there.  
So I became known as “Reed-breaker”.  

But now it’s not appropriate  
For me to break reeds with my hands.  
The training rules have been laid down for us  
By Gotama the renowned.  

Previously, I, Sarabhaṅga,  
Didn’t see the disease in its entirety.  
But now I have seen the disease,  
Because I practised what was taught  
By the one beyond the gods.  

Gotama travelled by that straight road;  
The same path travelled by Vipassī,  
The same path as Sikhī, Vessabhū,  
Kakusandha, Koṇāgamana, and Kassapa.  

By these seven Buddhas,  
Who plunged into the ending,  
Free of craving, without grasping,  
Having become Dhamma, poised,  
This Dhamma was taught,  

Out of compassion for living beings—  
Suffering, origin, path,  
And cessation, the ending of suffering.  

In these four noble truths,  
Suffering is stopped,  
This endless transmigration.  
When the body has broken up,  
And life has come to an end,  
There is no more rebirth into any state of existence:  
I’m well-liberated in every way.
