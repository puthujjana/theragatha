# Chapter Ten

*Translated by Bhikkhu Sujato.*

## 10.1 Kāḷudāyi  

“The trees are now crimson, venerable sir,  
They’ve shed their foliage, and are ready to fruit.  
They’re splendid, as if on fire;  
Great hero, this period is full of flavour.  

The blossoming trees are delightful,  
Wafting their scent all around, in all directions,  
They’ve shed their leaves and wish to fruit,  
Hero, it is time to depart from here.  

It is neither too hot nor too cold,  
Venerable sir, it’s a pleasant season for travelling.  
Let the Sākiyas and Koḷiyas see you,  
Facing west as you cross the Rohiṇī river.  

In hope, the field is ploughed;  
The seed is sown in hope;  
In hope, merchants travel the seas,  
Carrying rich cargoes.  
The hope that I stand for:  
May it succeed!  

Again and again, they sow the seed;  
Again and again, the king of gods sends rain;  
Again and again, farmers plough the field;  
Again and again, grain is produced for the nation.  

Again and again, the beggars wander,  
Again and again, the donors give,  
Again and again, when the donors have given,  
Again and again, they go to their place in heaven.  

A hero of vast wisdom purifies seven generations  
Of the family in which they’re born.  
Sakya, I believe you’re the king of kings,  
Since you fathered the one who is truly called a sage.  

The father of the great sage is named Suddhodana;  
But the Buddha’s mother is named Māyā.  
Having borne the Bodhisatta in her womb,  
She rejoices in the heaven of the Thirty-Three.  

When she died and passed away from here,  
She was blessed with divine sensual pleasures;  
Rejoicing in the five kinds of sensual pleasures,  
Gotamī is surrounded by those hosts of gods.”  

“I’m the son of the Buddha,  
The incomparable Aṅgīrasa, the poised—  
I bear the unbearable.  
You, Sakya, are my father’s father;  
Gotama, you are my grandfather in the Dhamma.”  


## 10.2 Ekavihāriya  

If no-one else is found  
In front or behind,  
It’s extremely pleasant,  
Dwelling alone in a forest grove.  

Come now, I’ll go alone  
To the wilderness praised by the Buddha.  
It’s pleasant for a monk  
Dwelling alone and resolute.  

Alone and self-disciplined,  
I’ll quickly enter the delightful forest,  
Which gives joy to meditators,  
And is frequented by rutting elephants.  

In Sītavana, so full of flowers,  
In a cool mountain cave,  
I’ll bathe my limbs  
And walk meditation alone.  

When will I dwell alone,  
Without a companion,  
In the great wood, so delightful,  
My task complete, free of defilements?  

This is what I want to do:  
May my wish succeed!  
I’ll make it happen myself:  
No-one can do someone else’s duty.  

Fastening my armour,  
I’ll enter the forest.  
I won’t leave here  
Until I have attained the end of defilements.  

As the cool breeze blows  
With fragrant scent,  
I’ll split ignorance apart,  
Sitting on the mountain-peak.  

In a forest grove covered with blossoms,  
In a cave so very cool,  
I take pleasure in Giribbaja,  
Happy with the happiness of freedom.  

My intentions are fulfilled  
Like the moon on the fifteenth day.  
With the utter ending of all defilements,  
Now there is no more rebirth  
Into any state of existence.  


## 10.3 Mahākappina  

If you’re prepared for the future,  
Both the good and the bad,  
Then those who look for your weakness,  
Whether enemies or well-wishers, will find none.  

One who has fulfilled, developed,  
And gradually consolidated  
Mindfulness of breathing  
As taught by the Buddha:  
They light up the world,  
Like the moon freed from a cloud.  

Yes, my mind is clean,  
Measureless, and well-developed;  
It is broken through and uplifted—  
It radiates in every direction.  

The wise person lives on  
Even after loss of wealth;  
But without gaining wisdom  
Even a rich person doesn’t really live.  

Understanding questions what is learned;  
Understanding grows fame and reputation;  
A person who has understanding  
Finds happiness even among sufferings.  

It’s not something just for today;  
It isn’t incredible or astonishing.  
When you’re born, you die—  
What’s astonishing about that?  

For anyone who is born,  
Death always follows after living.  
Everyone who is born here dies here;  
Such is the nature of living beings.  

The things that are useful for the living  
Are of no use for the dead—  
Not fame, not celebrity,  
Not praise by ascetics and brahmins;  
For the dead, there is only weeping.  

And weeping impairs the eye and the body;  
Complexion, health, and intelligence decline.  
Your enemies rejoice;  
But your well-wishers are not happy.  

So you should wish  
That those who stay in your family  
Have understanding and learning,  
And do their duty  
Through the power of understanding,  
Just as you’d cross a full river by boat.  


## 10.4 Cūḷapanthaka  

My progress was slow,  
I was despised in the past;  
My brother turned me away,  
Saying, “Go home now”.  

Turned away at the gate  
Of the Saṅgha’s monastery,  
I stood there sadly,  
Longing for the teaching.  

Then Blessed One came  
And touched my head.  
Taking me by the arm,  
He brought me into the Saṅgha’s monastery.  

The teacher, out of compassion,  
Gave me a foot-wiping cloth, saying:  
“Focus your awareness  
Exclusively on this clean cloth.”  

After I had listened to his words,  
I dwelt delighting in his teaching,  
Practising samādhi  
For the attainment of the highest goal.  

I know my past life;  
My clairvoyance is clarified;  
I’ve attained the three knowledges,  
And fulfilled the Buddha’s instructions.  

I, Panthaka, created a thousand  
Images of myself,  
And sat in the delightful mango grove  
Until the time for the meal offering was announced.  

Then the teacher sent to me  
A messenger to announce the time.  
When the time was announced,  
I flew to him through the air.  

I paid homage to the teacher’s feet,  
And sat to one side.  
When he knew I was seated,  
The teacher received the offering.  

Recipient of gifts from the whole world,  
Receiver of sacrifices,  
Field of merit for humanity,  
He received the offering.  


## 10.5 Kappa  

Filled with different kinds of dirt,  
A great producer of dung,  
Like a stagnant cesspool,  
A great boil, a great wound,  

Full of pus and blood,  
Sunk in a toilet-pit,  
Trickling with fluids:  
This putrid body always oozes.  

Bound by sixty tendons,  
Coated with a fleshy coating,  
Clothed in a jacket of skin,  
This putrid body is worthless.  

Held together by a skeleton of bones,  
And bound by sinews;  
It assumes postures  
Due to a complex of many things.  

We set out in the certainty of death,  
In the presence of the king of death;  
And having discarded the body right here,  
A person goes where he likes.  

Enveloped by ignorance,  
Tied by the four ties,  
This body is sinking in the flood,  
Caught in the net of underlying tendencies.  

Yoked with the five hindrances,  
Afflicted by thought,  
Accompanied by the root of craving,  
Hidden by delusion.  

So the body goes on,  
Propelled by the mechanism of deeds.  
But existence ends in perishing;  
Separated, the body perishes.  

Those blind, unawakened people  
Who think of this body as theirs,  
Swell the horrors of the charnel-ground,  
And take up rebirth again in some state of existence.  

Those who avoid this body,  
Like a snake smeared with dung,  
They expel the root of rebirth,  
And realise nibbāna, without defilements.  


## 10.6 Vaṅgantaputtaupasena  

In order to go on retreat,  
A monk should stay in lodgings  
That are secluded and quiet,  
Frequented by beasts of prey.  

Having gathered scraps from rubbish heaps,  
Cemeteries and streets,  
And making an outer robe from them,  
He should wear that coarse robe.  

Humbling his mind,  
A monk should walk for alms  
From family to family without exception,  
With sense doors guarded, well-restrained.  

He should be content even with coarse food,  
Not hoping for lots of flavours.  
The mind that is greedy for flavours  
Doesn’t delight in jhāna.  

With few wishes, content,  
A sage should live secluded.  
Socializing with neither  
Householders nor the homeless.  

He should appear  
To be stupid or dumb;  
A wise person would not speak overly long  
In the midst of the Saṅgha.  

He would not insult anyone,  
And would avoid causing harm.  
Restrained in accordance with the Pātimokkha,  
He would eat in moderation.  

Skilled in the arising of thought,  
He would grasp well the character of the mind.  
He would be devoted to practicing  
Serenity and insight at the right time.  

Though endowed with energy and perseverance,  
And always devoted to meditation,  
A wise person would not be too sure of themselves,  
Until they have attained the end of suffering.  

For a monk who dwells in this way,  
Longing for purification,  
All his defilements wither away,  
And he attains nibbāna.  


## 10.7 (Apara) Gotama  

You should understand your own purpose,  
And consider the teachings carefully,  
As well as what’s appropriate,  
For one who has entered the ascetic life.  

Good friendship in the community,  
Undertaking lots of training,  
Listening well to the teacher—  
This is appropriate for an ascetic.  

Respect for the Buddha,  
Reverence for the Dhamma as it really is,  
Esteem for the Saṅgha—  
This is appropriate for an ascetic.  

Devotion to good conduct and resort,  
A livelihood that is pure and blameless,  
And settling the mind—  
This is appropriate for an ascetic.  

A pleasing manner in things that should be done,  
And those that should be avoided;  
Devotion to the higher mind—  
This is appropriate for an ascetic.  

Wilderness lodgings  
Remote, with little noise,  
Fit for use by a sage—  
This is appropriate for an ascetic.  

Ethics, learning,  
Investigation of Dhamma as it really is,  
And penetration of the truths—  
This is appropriate for an ascetic.  

Developing the perceptions  
Of impermanence, non-self, and unattractiveness,  
And displeasure with the whole world—  
This is appropriate for an ascetic.  

Developing the factors of awakening,  
The bases for psychic power,  
The spiritual faculties and powers,  
And the noble eight-fold path—  
This is appropriate for an ascetic.  

A sage should abandon craving,  
With defilements split apart, root and all,  
They should live liberated—  
This is appropriate for an ascetic.
