# Chapter 5

*Translated by Bhikkhu Sujato.*

## 5.1 Rājadatta
I, a monk, went to a charnel ground  
And saw a woman left there,  
Discarded in a cemetery,  
Full of worms that devoured her.  

Some men were disgusted,  
Seeing her dead and rotten;  
But sexual desire arose in me,  
I was as if blind to her oozing body.  

Quicker than the boiling of rice  
I left that place,  
Mindful and aware,  
I sat down to one side.  

Then the realization  
Came upon me—  
The danger became clear,  
And I was firmly repulsed.  

Then my mind was liberated—  
See the excellence of the Dhamma!  
I’ve attained the three knowledges,  
And fulfilled the Buddha’s instructions.  


## 5.2 Subhūta  
If a person, wishing for a certain outcome,  
Applies themselves to a misguided endeavor,  
And they don’t achieve what they have practiced for,  
They say: “That’s a sign of my bad luck.”  

When a misfortune  
Has been plucked out and conquered,  
To give it up in part would be like  
The losing throw of the dice;  
But to give up everything  
Would be as if one was blind,  
Not discerning the even and the uneven.  

You should only say what you would do;  
You shouldn’t say what you wouldn’t do.  
The wise will recognize  
One who talks without doing.  

Just like a glorious flower  
That’s colourful but lacks fragrance;  
So is well-spoken speech fruitless  
For one not acting in accordance.  

Just like a glorious flower  
Is both colourful and fragrant,  
So is well-spoken speech fruitful  
For one who acts in accordance.  


## 5.3 Girimānanda  
The sky rains, like a beautiful song,  
My little hut is roofed and pleasant,  
Sheltered from the wind,  
I dwell there peacefully—  
So rain, sky, as you please.  

The sky rains, like a beautiful song,  
My little hut is roofed and pleasant,  
Sheltered from the wind,  
I dwell there, with peaceful mind—  
So rain, sky, as you please.  

The sky rains, like a beautiful song,  
My little hut is roofed and pleasant,  
Sheltered from the wind,  
I dwell there, free of lust—  
So rain, sky, as you please.  

The sky rains, like a beautiful song,  
My little hut is roofed and pleasant,  
Sheltered from the wind,  
I dwell there, free of hate—  
So rain, sky, as you please.  

The sky rains, like a beautiful song,  
My little hut is roofed and pleasant,  
Sheltered from the wind,  
I dwell there, free of delusion—  
So rain, sky, as you please.  


## 5.4 Sumana  
My mentor helped me to learn,  
Hoping that I would practice those teachings;  
Aspiring for the deathless,  
I’ve done what was to be done.  

I’ve arrived at the Dhamma,  
And witnessed it for myself, not based on hearsay.  
With purified knowledge, free of doubt,  
I declare it in your presence.  

I know my past life;  
My clairvoyance is clarified;  
I’ve realized my own true goal,  
The Buddha’s instruction is fulfilled.  

Being heedful in the training,  
I have learned your teachings well.  
All my defilements are ended;  
Now there is no more rebirth  
Into any state of existence.  

You advised me in noble ways;  
Compassionate, you helped teach me;  
Your instruction was not in vain—  
I, your student, am fully trained.  


## 5.5 Vaḍḍha  
It was good, how my mother  
Spurred me onwards.  
When I heard her words,  
Advised by my mother,  
I became energetic, resolute—  
I realised supreme awakening.  

I’m an Arahant, worthy of offerings,  
With the three knowledges  
And the vision of the deathless;  
I conquered Namuci’s army,  
And now I live without defilements.  

The defilements which I had,  
Both internally and externally,  
Are now all cut off without remainder;  
They won’t arise again.  

My skilful sister  
Said this to me:  
“Now neither you nor I  
Have any entanglements.”  

Suffering is at an end;  
This is the last body  
To transmigrate through birth and death:  
Now there is no more rebirth  
Into any state of existence.  


## 5.6 Nadīkassapa  
It was truly for my benefit  
That the Buddha went to the river Nerañjara;  
When I heard his teaching,  
I rejected wrong view.  

Previously, I performed the higher  
And lower sacrifices;  
I worshipped the sacred flame,  
Thinking, “This is purity.”  
I was a blind, unenlightened person.  

Caught in the thicket of wrong view,  
Deluded by misapprehension;  
Thinking impurity was purity,  
I was blind and ignorant.  

I’ve abandoned wrong view,  
Rebirth into any state of existence is torn apart,  
I worship what is truly worthy of offerings:  
I bow to the Tathāgata.  

I’ve abandoned all delusion,  
Rebirth into any state of existence is torn apart,  
Transmigration through births is finished,  
Now there is no more rebirth  
Into any state of existence.  


## 5.7 Gayākassapa  
Three times a day—  
Morning, midday, and evening—  
I went down into the water at Gayā,  
For the Gayā spring festival.  

“Whatever bad things I’ve done  
In previous births,  
I’ll now wash away right here”—  
This is the view I previously held.  

Having heard the well-spoken words  
Regarding the Dhamma and the goal,  
I wisely reflected  
On the true, essential goal.  

I’ve washed away all bad things;  
I’m stainless, cleansed, pristine;  
The pure heir of the pure one,  
A rightful son of the Buddha.  

When I plunged into the eight-fold stream,  
All bad things were washed away.  
I’ve attained the three knowledges,  
And fulfilled the Buddha’s instructions.  


## 5.8 Vakkali  
“Struck by a wind ailment,  
While staying in a forest grove;  
You’ve gone into a tough place for gathering alms:  
How will you get by, monk?”  

“Pervading my body  
With lots of rapture and happiness,  
Putting up with what’s tough,  
I’ll dwell in the forest.  

Developing the establishments of mindfulness,  
The faculties and the powers,  
Developing the factors of awakening,  
I’ll dwell in the forest.  

Having seen those who are energetic, resolute,  
Always of strong effort,  
Harmonious and serene,  
I’ll dwell in the forest.  

Recollecting the Buddha,  
The highest, the tamed, who has samādhi;  
Not lazy by day or by night,  
I’ll dwell in the forest.”  


## 5.9 Vijitasena  
I’ll cage you, mind,  
Like an elephant in a stockade.  
Born of the flesh, that net of sensual pleasures,  
I won’t urge you to do bad.  

Caged, you won’t escape,  
Like an elephant who can’t find an open gate.  
Demon-mind, you won’t wander again and again,  
Bullying, and loving to do bad.  

Just as a strong trainer with a hook,  
Takes a wild, newly captured elephant  
And wins it over against its will,  
So I’ll win you over.  

Just as a fine charioteer,  
Skilled in the taming of fine horses,  
Tames a thoroughbred,  
So, firmly established in the five powers,  
I’ll tame you.  

I’ll bind you with mindfulness,  
I’m committed to taming you;  
Restrained by harnessed energy,  
Mind, you won’t go far from here.  


## 5.10 Yasadatta  
With fault-finding mind, the dullard  
Listens to the conqueror’s teaching.  
They’re as far from true Dhamma,  
As the earth is from the sky.  

With fault-finding mind, the dullard  
Listens to the conqueror’s teaching.  
They decline in the true Dhamma,  
Like the moon in the waning fortnight.  

With fault-finding mind, the dullard  
Listens to the conqueror’s teaching.  
They wither away in the true Dhamma,  
Like a fish in too little water.  

With fault-finding mind, the dullard  
Listens to the conqueror’s teaching.  
They don’t thrive in the true Dhamma,  
Like a rotten seed in a field.  

But one with contented mind  
Who listens to the conqueror’s teachings—  
Having ended all defilements,  
Having witnessed the unshakable,  
Having arrived at the highest peace—  
They realize nibbāna without defilements.  


## 5.11 Soṇakuṭikaṇṇa  
I’ve received full ordination,  
I am liberated, without defilements,  
I’ve seen the Blessed One myself,  
And even stayed together with him.  

The Blessed One, the teacher,  
Spent much of the night in the open;  
Then he, who is so skilled at dwelling in meditation,  
Entered his dwelling.  

Spreading out his outer robe,  
Gotama made his bed;  
Like a lion in a rocky cave,  
With fear and dread abandoned.  

Then, with lovely enunciation,  
Soṇa, a disciple of the Buddha,  
Recited the true Dhamma  
In the presence of the best of Buddhas.  

When he has fully understood the five aggregates,  
Developed the straight path,  
And arrived at the highest peace,  
He will realize nibbāna without defilements.  


## 5.12 Kosiya  
Whatever wise person,  
Understanding their teacher’s words,  
Stays with them, their affection growing;  
That wise person is indeed devoted—  
Knowing about Dhammas, they’re distinguished.  

When extreme stresses arise,  
Whoever does not tremble, but reflects instead,  
That wise person is indeed strong—  
Knowing about Dhammas, they’re distinguished.  

Steady as the ocean, imperturbable,  
Their wisdom is deep, and they see the subtle goal;  
That wise person is indeed immovable—  
Knowing about Dhammas, they’re distinguished.  

They’re very learned, and have memorized the Dhamma,  
Practising Dhamma in accordance with Dhamma;  
That wise person is indeed such—  
Knowing about Dhammas, they’re distinguished.  

They know the meaning of what is said,  
And having known, they act appropriately;  
That wise person is indeed  
One who has mastered the meaning—  
Knowing about Dhammas, they’re distinguished.
