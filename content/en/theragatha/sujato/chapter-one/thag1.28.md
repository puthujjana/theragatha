# 1.28 Jambugāmika Tissa  

“What is the one thing,” said the wanderer,  
“That a mendicant must rightly explain?”  
“The one thing,” said Tissa,  
“Is suffering, which the Blessed One declared.”  
“Well then, what is the path,” said the wanderer,  
“For ending suffering and stress?”  
“The noble eightfold path,” said Tissa,  
“Is the path declared by the Blessed One.”
