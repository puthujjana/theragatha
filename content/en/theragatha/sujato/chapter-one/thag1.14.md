# 1.14 Novice Sivaka  

My preceptor said:  
“Let’s go from here, Sīvaka.”  
My body lives in the village,  
But my mind has gone to the wilderness.  
I’ll go there even if I’m lying down;  
There’s no tying down one who understands.

## Notes

<!-- 1. Compare this with this account of an interaction between the Desert Father Abba Sisois and his attendant:

>"ABRAHAM, the disciple of Abbot Sisois, said to him: Father, you are an
old man. Let’s go back to the world. Abbot Sisois replied: Very well,
we’ll go where there are no women. His disciple said: What is the
place in which there are no women, except the desert alone? The
elder replied to him: Therefore take me into the desert." (Merton, 2012)
