# Chapter Thirteen

*Translated by Bhikkhu Sujato.*

## 13.1 Soṇakoḷivisa  

He who was special in the kingdom,  
The attendant to the king of Aṅga,  
Today is special in the Dhamma—  
Soṇa has gone beyond suffering.  

Five should be cut off, five should be abandoned,  
Five should be developed further.  
A monk who has gone beyond  
Five attachments is called  
“One who has crossed the flood.”  

If a monk is insolent and negligent,  
Concerned only with externals,  
Their virtue, samādhi, and understanding  
Do not become fulfilled.  

They disregard what should be done,  
And do what shouldn’t be done.  
For the insolent and the negligent,  
Their defilements only grow.  

Those that have properly undertaken  
Constant mindfulness of the body,  
Don’t practise what shouldn’t be done,  
But consistently do what should be done.  
Mindful and clearly aware,  
Their defilements come to an end.  

Go on the straight path that has been taught—  
Don’t turn back.  
Urge yourself on,  
And realise nibbāna.  

When my energy was over-exerted,  
The unsurpassed teacher in the world,  
Made the simile of the lute for me;  
The Seer taught the Dhamma,  
And when I heard what he said,  
I stayed joyfully in his teaching.  

Practising serenity of mind,  
I attained the supreme goal.  
I’ve attained the three knowledges,  
And fulfilled the Buddha’s instructions.  

Committed to renunciation,  
And seclusion of the heart,  
Committed to non-harming,  
And the end of grasping;  

Committed to the end of craving,  
And an unconfused heart;  
When seeing the senses arise,  
The mind is perfectly liberated.  

For the monk who is perfectly liberated,  
His mind at peace,  
There’s nothing to add to what has been done;  
And nothing further to be done.  

Just as a solid rock  
Is not moved by the wind,  
So sights, tastes, sounds  
Smells, touches, all of these,  

As well as pleasant and unpleasant phenomena,  
Don’t shake one who is poised,  
Whose mind is firm and unfettered,  
Contemplating vanishing.
