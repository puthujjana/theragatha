## 4.6 Senaka  


During the spring festival at Gayā,  
It was so welcome for me  
To see the Buddha,  
Teaching the supreme Dhamma.  

He was glorious, the teacher of a community,  
Who had realised the highest, a leader,  
Conqueror of the world with its gods;  
His vision was unequalled.  

A great being of power, a great hero,  
A great light, without defilements.  
With the utter ending of all defilements,  
The teacher has no fear from any direction.  

For a long time, sadly, I was corrupted,  
Fettered by the bond of wrong view.  
That Blessed One, Senaka,  
Released me from all ties.
