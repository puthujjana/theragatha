## 4.3 Sabhiya  


Others don’t understand  
That here we come to our end.  
Those that do understand this  
Settle their quarrels because of that.  

And when those who don’t understand  
Behave as though they were immortal;  
Those who understand the Dhamma  
Are like the healthy among the sick.  

Any lax act,  
Or corrupt religious observance,  
Or a spiritual life arousing suspicion,  
Does not yield great fruit.  

Whoever has no respect  
For their companions in the spiritual life  
Is as far from true Dhamma  
As the sky is from the earth.
