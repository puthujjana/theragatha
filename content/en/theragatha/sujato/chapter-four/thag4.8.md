## 4.8 Rāhula  


I am known as “Fortunate Rāhula”,  
Because I’m endowed in both ways:  
I am the son of the Buddha,  
And I have the vision of the Dhammas.  

Since my defilements have ended,  
Since there is no more being reborn  
In any state of existence—  
I’m an Arahant, worthy of offerings,  
With the three knowledges  
And the vision of the deathless.  

Blinded by sensual pleasures, trapped in a net,  
They are smothered over by craving,  
Bound by the Kinsman of the Negligent,  
Like a fish caught in a funnel-net trap.  

Having thrown off those sensual pleasures,  
Having cut Māra’s bond,  
Having pulled out craving, roots and all:  
I’ve become cool, and realized nibbāna.
