## 4.7 Sambhūta  


Hurrying when it’s time for going slowly;  
Going slowly when it’s time to hurry;  
That fool falls into suffering  
Because of these muddled arrangements.  

Their good fortune wastes away  
Like the moon in the waning fortnight;  
They become disgraced,  
And alienated from their friends.  

Going slowly when it’s time for going slowly;  
Hurrying when it’s time to hurry;  
That wise person comes into happiness  
Because of these proper arrangements.  

Their good fortune flourishes  
Like the moon in the waxing fortnight;  
They become famous and respected,  
Not alienated from their friends.
