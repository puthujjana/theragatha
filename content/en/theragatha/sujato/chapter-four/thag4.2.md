## 4.2 Bhagu  


Overwhelmed by drowsiness,  
I came out of my dwelling;  
Stepping up on to the walking meditation path,  
I fell to the ground right there.  

I rubbed my limbs, and again  
I stepped up on to the walking meditation path.  
I walked meditation up and down the path,  
Serene inside myself.  

Then the realization  
Came upon me—  
The danger became clear,  
And I was firmly repulsed.  

Then my mind was liberated—  
See the excellence of the Dhamma!  
I’ve attained the three knowledges,  
And fulfilled the Buddha’s instructions.
