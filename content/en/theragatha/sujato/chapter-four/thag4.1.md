## 4.1 Nāgasamāla  


There’s a dancer along the highway,  
Dancing as the music plays;  
She’s adorned with jewellery and all dressed up,  
With a garland of flowers  
And perfume of sandalwood.  

I entered for alms,  
And while going along I glanced at her,  
Adorned with jewellery and all dressed up,  
Like a snare of death laid down.  

Then the realization  
Came upon me—  
The danger became clear,  
And I was firmly repulsed.  

Then my mind was liberated—  
See the excellence of the Dhamma!  
I’ve attained the three knowledges,  
And fulfilled the Buddha’s instructions.
