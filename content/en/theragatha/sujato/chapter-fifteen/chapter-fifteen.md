# Chapter Fifteen

*Translated by Bhikkhu Sujato.*

## 15.1 Aññāsikoṇḍañña  

“My confidence grew  
As I heard the Dhamma, so full of flavor.  
Dispassion was the Dhamma that was taught,  
Without any grasping at all.”  

“There are many pretty things  
In the circle of this earth;  
They disturb one’s thoughts, I believe,  
Beautiful, provoking lust.  

Just as a rain cloud would settle  
The dust blown up by the wind;  
So thoughts settle down  
When seen with understanding.  

All conditions are impermanent—  
When this is seen with understanding,  
One turns away from suffering:  
This is the path to purity.  

All conditions are suffering—  
When this is seen with understanding,  
One turns away from suffering:  
This is the path to purity.  

All phenomena are not-self—  
When this is seen with understanding,  
One turns away from suffering:  
This is the path to purity.  

The senior monk Koṇḍañña, who was awakened  
Right after the Buddha, is keenly energetic.  
He has abandoned birth and death,  
And has perfected the spiritual life.  

There are floods, snares, and strong posts,  
And a mountain hard to crack;  
Snapping the posts and snares,  
Breaking the mountain so hard to break,  
Crossing over to the far shore,  
One practicing jhāna is freed from Māra’s bonds.  

A haughty and fickle monk,  
Relying on bad friends,  
Sinks down in the great flood,  
Overcome by a wave.  

But one who is humble and stable,  
Controlled, with senses restrained,  
Wise, with good friends,  
Would put an end to suffering.  

With knobbly knees,  
Thin, with veins matted on his skin,  
Eating and drinking in moderation—  
This person’s spirit is undaunted.  

Pestered by gadflies and mosquitoes  
In the awesome wilderness;  
One should mindfully endure,  
Like an elephant at the head of the battle.  

I don’t long for death;  
I don’t long for life;  
I await my time,  
Like a worker waiting for their wages.  

I don’t long for death;  
I don’t long for life;  
I await my time,  
Aware and mindful.  

I’ve attended on the teacher  
And fulfilled the Buddha’s instructions.  
The heavy burden is laid down,  
I’ve undone the attachment to being reborn  
In any state of existence.  

I’ve attained the goal  
For the sake of which I went forth  
From home life into homelessness—  
What use do I have for students?  

## 15.2 Udāyi  

An person who has become  
Awakened as a human being,  
Self-tamed, with samādhi,  
Following the spiritual path,  
Delights in peace of mind.  

Revered by people,  
Gone beyond all things,  
Even the gods revere him;  
So I’ve heard from the Arahant.  

He has transcended all fetters,  
And escaped from entanglements,  
Delighting in the renunciation of sensual pleasures,  
He is liberated like gold from stone.  

That elephant outshines all,  
As the Himālaya outshines other mountains.  
Of all those named “elephant”,  
He is truly named, and unsurpassed.  

I’ll extol the elephant to you,  
For he does nothing wrong.  
The elephant’s front two feet  
Are gentleness and harmlessness.  

Mindfulness and awareness  
Are the elephant’s other feet.  
Faith is the great elephant’s trunk,  
And equanimity is the white tusks.  

Mindfulness is his neck, his head is understanding—  
The investigation and reflection on phenomena—  
His belly is the sacred hearth of the Dhamma,  
His tail is seclusion.  

Practicing jhāna, delighting in the breath,  
Serene inside himself.  
The elephant is serene when walking,  
The elephant is serene when standing,  

The elephant is serene when lying down,  
And when sitting, the elephant is serene.  
The elephant is restrained everywhere:  
This is the accomplishment of the elephant.  

He eats blameless things,  
He doesn’t eat blameworthy things.  
When he gets food and clothes,  
He avoids storing them up.  

Having cut off all bonds,  
Fetters large and small,  
Wherever he goes,  
He goes without longing.  

Just as a white lotus,  
Fragrant and delightful,  
Is born in water and grows there,  
But the water does not stick to it;  

So the Buddha is born in the world,  
And lives in the world,  
But the world does not stick to him,  
As the water does not stick to the lotus.  

A great blazing fire  
Dies down when the fuel runs out;  
When the coals have gone out  
It’s said to be “quenched”.  

This simile is taught by the discerning  
To express the meaning clearly.  
Great elephants will understand  
What the elephant taught the elephant.  

Free of desire, free of hatred,  
Free of delusion, without defilements,  
The elephant, abandoning their body,  
Realises nibbāna without defilements.
