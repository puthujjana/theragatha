## 15.1 Aññāsikoṇḍañña  


“My confidence grew  
As I heard the Dhamma, so full of flavor.  
Dispassion was the Dhamma that was taught,  
Without any grasping at all.”  

“There are many pretty things  
In the circle of this earth;  
They disturb one’s thoughts, I believe,  
Beautiful, provoking lust.  

Just as a rain cloud would settle  
The dust blown up by the wind;  
So thoughts settle down  
When seen with understanding.  

All conditions are impermanent—  
When this is seen with understanding,  
One turns away from suffering:  
This is the path to purity.  

All conditions are suffering—  
When this is seen with understanding,  
One turns away from suffering:  
This is the path to purity.  

All phenomena are not-self—  
When this is seen with understanding,  
One turns away from suffering:  
This is the path to purity.  

The senior monk Koṇḍañña, who was awakened  
Right after the Buddha, is keenly energetic.  
He has abandoned birth and death,  
And has perfected the spiritual life.  

There are floods, snares, and strong posts,  
And a mountain hard to crack;  
Snapping the posts and snares,  
Breaking the mountain so hard to break,  
Crossing over to the far shore,  
One practicing jhāna is freed from Māra’s bonds.  

A haughty and fickle monk,  
Relying on bad friends,  
Sinks down in the great flood,  
Overcome by a wave.  

But one who is humble and stable,  
Controlled, with senses restrained,  
Wise, with good friends,  
Would put an end to suffering.  

With knobbly knees,  
Thin, with veins matted on his skin,  
Eating and drinking in moderation—  
This person’s spirit is undaunted.  

Pestered by gadflies and mosquitoes  
In the awesome wilderness;  
One should mindfully endure,  
Like an elephant at the head of the battle.  

I don’t long for death;  
I don’t long for life;  
I await my time,  
Like a worker waiting for their wages.  

I don’t long for death;  
I don’t long for life;  
I await my time,  
Aware and mindful.  

I’ve attended on the teacher  
And fulfilled the Buddha’s instructions.  
The heavy burden is laid down,  
I’ve undone the attachment to being reborn  
In any state of existence.  

I’ve attained the goal  
For the sake of which I went forth  
From home life into homelessness—  
What use do I have for students?
