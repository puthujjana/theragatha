## 3.9 Yasoja  

“With knobbly knees,  
Thin, with veins matted on his skin,  
Eating and drinking in moderation—  
This person’s spirit is undaunted.”  
“Pestered by gadflies and mosquitoes  
In the awesome wilderness;  
One should mindfully endure,  
Like an elephant at the head of the battle.  
A monk alone is like Brahmā;  
A pair of monks are like devas;  
Three are like a village;  
And more than that is a rabble.”
