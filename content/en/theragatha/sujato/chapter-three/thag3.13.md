## 3.13 Abhibhūta  

All my family gathered here,  
Listen to me,  
I’ll teach you Dhamma!  
Being born again and again is suffering.  
Rouse yourselves, let go!  
Devote yourselves to the teachings of the Buddha!  
Crush the army of death,  
Like an elephant crushes a hut of reeds.  
Whoever will live heedfully  
In this Dhamma and discipline,  
Will abandon transmigration through births,  
And make an end to suffering.
