## 3.14 Gotama  

Transmigrating, I went to hell;  
Again and again, I went to the ghost realm;  
Many times I dwelt long  
In the suffering of the animal realm.  
I was also reborn as a human;  
From time to time I went to heaven;  
I’ve stayed in the corporeal realms  
And the incorporeal,  
Among the percipient-nor-non-percipient,  
And the non-percipient.  
I understood these states of existence  
To be worthless:  
Conditioned, unstable, always in motion.  
When I understood the origin  
Of rebirth within myself,  
Mindful, I found peace.
