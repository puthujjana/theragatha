## 3.16 Vimala  

Avoiding bad friends,  
You should associate with the best of people.  
Stick to the advice that he gave you,  
Aspiring for unshakable happiness.  
If someone lost in the middle of the ocean,  
Were to clamber up on a little log, they’d sink;  
In the same way, even a good person would sink  
If they rely on a lazy person.  
So avoid those who are lazy, lacking energy.  
Instead, dwell with the wise—  
Secluded, noble,  
Resolute, practising jhāna,  
And always energetic.
