## 3.12 Uttarapāla  

Sadly, I was intelligent and peaceful,  
But only enough to critically analyse the meaning.  
The five kinds of sensual pleasure in the world,  
So delusory, were my downfall.  
Entering into Māra’s domain,  
I was struck by a powerful dart;  
But I was able to free myself  
From the trap laid by the king of death.  
All sensual pleasures have been abandoned,  
Rebirth in all states of existence is torn apart,  
Transmigration through births is finished,  
Now there is no more rebirth  
Into any state of existence.
