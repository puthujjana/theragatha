## 3.11 Upāli  

One newly gone forth,  
Who has left their home out of faith,  
Should associate with spiritual friends,  
Whose livelihood is pure, and who are not lazy.  
One newly gone forth,  
Who has left their home out of faith,  
A monk who stays with the Saṅgha,  
Being wise, would train in monastic discipline.  
One newly gone forth,  
Who has left their home out of faith,  
Skilled in what is appropriate and what is not,  
Would wander undistracted.
