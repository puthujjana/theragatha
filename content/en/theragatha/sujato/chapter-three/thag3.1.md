## 3.1 Aṅgaṇikabhāradvāja  

Seeking purity the wrong way,  
I worshipped the sacred fire in a grove.  
Not knowing the path to purity,  
I mortified my flesh in search of immortality.  
I’ve gained this happiness by means of happiness:  
See the excellence of the Dhamma!  
I’ve attained the three knowledges,  
And fulfilled the Buddha’s instructions.  
In the past I was related to Brahmā,  
But now I’m really a brahmin:  
I have the three knowledges, I’m cleansed,  
I’m an initiate,  
And I’m accomplished in sacred knowledge.
