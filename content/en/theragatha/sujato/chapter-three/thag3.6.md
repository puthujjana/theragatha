## 3.6 Khujjasobhita  

“One of those monks who live in Pāṭaliputta—  
Such brilliant speakers, and very learned—  
Stands at the door:  
The old man, Khujjasobhita.  
One of those monks who live in Pāṭaliputta—  
Such brilliant speakers, and very learned—  
Stands at the door:  
An old man, trembling in the wind.”  
“By war well fought, by sacrifice well made,  
By victory in battle;  
By living the spiritual life:  
That’s how this person flourishes in happiness.”
