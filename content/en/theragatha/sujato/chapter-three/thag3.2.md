## 3.2 Paccaya  

I went forth five days ago,  
A trainee, with my heart’s goal unfulfilled.  
I entered my dwelling,  
And an aspiration arose in my mind.  
I won’t eat; I won’t drink;  
I won’t leave my dwelling;  
Nor will I lie down on my side—  
Until the dart of craving is pulled out.  
See my energy and effort  
As I practice this way!  
I’ve attained the three knowledges,  
And fulfilled the Buddha’s instructions.
