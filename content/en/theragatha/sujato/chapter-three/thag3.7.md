## 3.7 Vāraṇa  

Anyone among men  
Who harms other creatures:  
From this world and the next,  
That person will fall.  
But someone with a mind of loving-kindness,  
Compassionate for all creatures:  
That sort of person  
Gives rise to merit in abundance.  
One should train in good speech,  
In attending closely to ascetics,  
In sitting alone in hidden places,  
And in calming the mind.
