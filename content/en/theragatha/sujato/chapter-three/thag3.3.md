## 3.3 Bākula  

Whoever wishes to do afterwards  
What they should have done before  
They’ve lost the causes for happiness,  
And afterwards they’re tormented with remorse.  
You should only say what you would do;  
You shouldn’t say what you wouldn’t do.  
The wise will recognize  
One who talks without doing.  
Oh! nibbāna is so very blissful,  
As taught by the fully awakened Buddha:  
Sorrowless, stainless, secure;  
Where suffering all ceases.
