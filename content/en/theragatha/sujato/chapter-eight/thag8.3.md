## 8.3 Mahāpanthaka  


When I first saw the teacher,  
Who was free of fear from any direction,  
I was struck with awe,  
Since I’d seen the best of men.  

If you have the good luck  
To find such a teacher,  
But you push it all away,  
You’ll lose your chance.  

Then I left behind my children and wife,  
My riches and my grain;  
I cut off my hair and beard,  
And went forth into homelessness.  

Endowed with the monastic training and livelihood,  
My sense faculties well-restrained,  
Paying homage to the Buddha,  
I dwelt undefeated.  

Then a resolve occurred to me,  
My heart’s truest wish:  
I wouldn’t sit down, not even for a moment,  
Until the dart of craving was pulled out.  

As I dwell like this,  
See my energy and striving!  
I’ve attained the three knowledges,  
And fulfilled the Buddha’s instructions.  

I know my past life;  
My clairvoyance is clarified;  
I’m an Arahant, worthy of offerings,  
Liberated, without attachments.  

Then, at the end of the night,  
As the rising of the sun drew near,  
All craving was dried up,  
So I sat down cross-legged.
