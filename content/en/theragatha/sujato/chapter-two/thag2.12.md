## 2.12 Jotidāsa  

People who act harshly—  
Attacking people,  
Tying them up,  
Hurting them in all kinds of ways—  
They’re treated in the same way;  
Their deeds don’t vanish.  

Whatever deeds a person does,  
Whether for good or for bad,  
They are the heir to each  
And every deed that they perform.
