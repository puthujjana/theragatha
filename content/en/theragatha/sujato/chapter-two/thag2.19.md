## 2.19 Nanda  

I used my mind unwisely,  
I was addicted to ornamentation.  
I was vain, fickle,  
Tormented by desire for sensual pleasures.  

But with the help of the Buddha,  
The Kinsman of the Sun, so skilled in means,  
I practiced wisely,  
And extracted any attachment  
To being reborn from my mind.
