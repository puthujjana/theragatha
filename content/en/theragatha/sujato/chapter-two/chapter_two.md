# Chapter Two

*Translated by Bhikkhu Sujato.*

## 2.1 Uttara  
No life is permanent,  
And no conditions last forever.  
The aggregates are reborn  
And pass away, again and again.  

Knowing this danger,  
I’m not interested in being reborn  
Into any state of existence.  
I’ve escaped all sensual pleasures,  
And attained the end of defilements.  

## 2.2 Piṇḍolabhāradvāja  
You can’t live by fasting,  
But food doesn’t lead to peace of heart.  
Seeing how the body is sustained by food,  
I wander, seeking.  

They know it’s a swamp,  
This worship and homage from respectable families;  
A subtle dart, hard to pull out;  
It’s hard for a corrupt person to give up honour.  

## 2.3 Valliya  
A monkey went up to the little hut  
With five doors.  
He circles around, knocking  
On each door, again and again.  

Stand still monkey, don’t run!  
Things are different now;  
You’ve been caught by wisdom—  
You won’t go far.  

## 2.4 Gaṅgātīriya  
My hut on the bank of the Ganges  
Is made from three palm leaves.  
My alms-bowl is a funeral pot,  
My robe is cast-off rags.  

In my first two rainy seasons  
I spoke only one word.  
In my third rainy season,  
The mass of darkness was torn apart.  

## 2.5 Ajina  
Even someone with the three knowledges,  
Who has conquered death,  
And is without defilements,  
Is looked down on for being unknown  
By fools without wisdom.  

But a person who gets food and drink  
Is honored by them,  
Even if they are of bad character.  

## 2.6 Meḷajina  
When I heard the Teacher  
Speaking Dhamma,  
I wasn’t aware of any doubt  
In the all-knowing, unconquered one,  
The caravan leader, the great hero,  
The most excellent of charioteers.  

I have no doubt  
In the path or practice.  

## 2.7 Rādha  
Just as rain seeps into  
A poorly roofed house,  
Lust seeps into  
An undeveloped mind.  

Just as rain doesn’t seep into  
A well roofed house,  
Lust doesn’t seep into  
A well-developed mind.  

## 2.8 Surādha  
Rebirth is ended for me,  
The conqueror’s instruction is fulfilled,  
What they call a “net” is abandoned,  
The attachment to being reborn  
In any state of existence is undone.  

I’ve arrived at the goal  
For the sake of which I went forth  
From the home life into homelessness:  
The ending of all fetters.  

## 2.9 Gotama  
Sages sleep happily  
When they’re not attached to women;  
For the truth is hard to find among them,  
And one must always be guarded.  

Sensual pleasure, you’ve been slain!  
We’re not in your debt any more.  
Now we go to nibbāna,  
Where there is no more sorrow.  

## 2.10 Vasabha  
First one kills oneself,  
Then one kills others.  
One kills oneself, really dead,  
Like one who kills birds using a dead bird as a decoy.  

A holy man’s color is not on the outside;  
A holy man is colored on the inside.  
Whoever does bad deeds  
Such a one is truly dark, Sujampati.  

## 2.11 Mahācunda  
It is from wishing to learn that learning grows;  
When you are learned, understanding grows;  
Through understanding, you know the goal;  
Knowing the goal brings happiness.  

Make use of secluded lodgings!  
Practice to be released from fetters!  
If you don’t find enjoyment there,  
Live in the Saṅgha, guarded and mindful.  

## 2.12 Jotidāsa  
People who act harshly—  
Attacking people,  
Tying them up,  
Hurting them in all kinds of ways—  
They’re treated in the same way;  
Their deeds don’t vanish.  

Whatever deeds a person does,  
Whether for good or for bad,  
They are the heir to each  
And every deed that they perform.  

## 2.13 Heraññakāni  
The days and nights rush by,  
And then life is cut short.  
The vitality of mortals wastes away,  
Like the water in tiny streams.  

But while doing bad deeds  
The fool doesn’t realize—  
It’ll be bitter later on;  
Yes, the result will be bad for him.  

## 2.14 Somamitta  
If someone lost in the middle of the ocean,  
Were to clamber up on a little log, they’d sink;  
In the same way, even a good person would sink  
If they rely on a lazy person.  

So avoid those who are lazy, lacking energy.  
Instead, dwell with the wise—  
Secluded, noble,  
Resolute, practising jhāna,  
And always energetic.  

## 2.15 Sabbamitta  
People are attached to people;  
People are dependent on people;  
People are hurt by people;  
And people hurt people.  

What’s the point of people,  
Or the things people make?  
Go, leave these people,  
Who’ve hurt so many people.  

## 2.16 Mahākāḷa  
There’s a big black woman who looks like a crow.  
She broke off thigh-bones, first one then another;  
She broke off arm-bones, first one then another;  
She broke off a skull like a curd-bowl, and then—  
She assembled them all together  
And sat down beside them.  

When an ignorant person builds up attachments,  
That idiot returns to suffering, again and again.  
So let one who understands not build up attachments:  
May I never again lie with a broken skull!  

## 2.17 Tissa  
When your head is shaven,  
And you’re wrapped in the outer robe,  
You’ll have many enemies  
When you receive food and drink,  
Clothes and lodgings.  

Knowing this danger,  
This great fear in honours,  
A monk should go forth mindfully,  
With few possessions, and not full of desire.  

## 2.18 Kimila  
In Pācīnavaṃsa grove  
The companions of the Sakyans,  
Having given up much wealth,  
Are satisfied with whatever is put in their bowls.  

Energetic, resolute,  
Always strong in striving;  
Having given up mundane satisfaction,  
They delight in the satisfaction of Dhamma.  

## 2.19 Nanda  
I used my mind unwisely,  
I was addicted to ornamentation.  
I was vain, fickle,  
Tormented by desire for sensual pleasures.  

But with the help of the Buddha,  
The Kinsman of the Sun, so skilled in means,  
I practiced wisely,  
And extracted any attachment  
To being reborn from my mind.  

## 2.20 Sirimā  
If they praise someone  
Who doesn’t have samādhi,  
The praise is in vain,  
As they don’t have samādhi.  

If they rebuke someone  
Who does have samādhi,  
The rebuke is in vain,  
As they do have samādhi.  

## 2.21 Uttara  
I’ve fully understood the aggregates,  
I’ve undone craving;  
I’ve developed the factors of awakening,  
And I’ve realized the ending of defilements.  

Having fully understood the aggregates,  
Having plucked out the weaver of the web,  
Having developed the factors of awakening,  
I’ll realize nibbāna, without defilements.  

## 2.22 Bhaddiya Kāligodhāputta  
“Ah, happiness! Ah, happiness!”—thus they call me.  
But I wasn’t unhappy before, nor am I unhappy now.  

Before, I had what I wanted,  
Now I have no desire for anything.  

## 2.23 Khaṇḍasumana  
The flower of a well-kept garden  
Can be seen from afar;  
In the same way, the words of a well-spoken monk  
Shine far and wide.  

## 2.24 Tissa  
You were impatient,  
When you heard the Teacher’s words;  
You didn’t follow his instruction,  
You didn’t listen carefully.  

But now you follow the instruction,  
The word of the Teacher;  
Mindful, you guard the Dhamma;  
You’ve abandoned birth and death.  

## 2.25 Abhaya  
Whoever undertakes the holy life,  
Intending to find peace of mind,  
Should be scrupulous and restrained,  
Mindful and fully aware.  

When you go out,  
When you come back,  
When you look ahead and aside,  
Restrain yourself in all situations.  

## 2.26 Uttiya  
Go beyond being clever,  
And give up all cleverness;  
Don’t get caught up in conceit,  
But train yourself in peace.  

Go beyond the pathless jungle,  
The bondage of Māra.  
Be without attachments,  
And realize the supreme peace.  

## 2.27 Devasabha  
Speak only after considering  
The words you are about to say;  
Don’t speak lies,  
And don’t say what will lead to harm.  

When you speak the truth,  
Say what’s beneficial,  
And don’t hurt anyone—  
That’s the Dhamma of the Buddhas.  

## 2.28 Belaṭṭhakāni  
A monk who is devoted to meditation,  
Delighting in the Dhamma,  
Who is mindful, energetic, and calm,  
Will blow away Māra and his army,  
As a great wind blows away a heap of cotton.  

## 2.29 Dāsaka  
There’s no fire like lust,  
No holding like hate,  
No net like delusion,  
No river like craving.  

There’s no higher state than peace,  
No happiness beyond contentment,  
No sickness like the aggregates,  
No greater strength than wisdom.  

## 2.30 Siṅgālapitaka  
As a man might lay down a load  
And rest his burden on the ground,  
So I lay down the heavy load  
And reach nibbāna.  

My mind is completely liberated;  
My path has been fully purified;  
I’ve reached the destruction of craving;  
I’ve attained the end of suffering.  

## 2.31 Sundara Samudda  
The monk who, through direct knowledge,  
Is released from the snares of Māra—  
The darkness is shattered for him,  
He sees the unseeable.  

## 2.32 Nitta  
This body is a disease,  
A lump, a boil, a wound;  
It’s tormented, miserable, and frail,  
A putrid thing, oozing with filth.  

I have realized the truth about this body—  
Truly, it’s impermanent and not-self.  
Having gone beyond all suffering,  
I’m cooled, quenched, and free.  

## 2.33 Gosāla  
My heart was agitated,  
Like a fish tossed up on land.  
But when I practiced mindfulness of the body,  
I found peace and calm.  

## 2.34 Sugita  
Though someone speaks well,  
If they act badly, they are not good.  
But one who does what is good,  
Even if they don’t speak much, is truly good.  

## 2.35 Nandiya  
When I was foolish and ignorant,  
I wandered in the world of birth and death.  
But now I’ve understood the aggregates;  
The great darkness is torn apart.  

## 2.36 Ubhaya  
I’ve fully understood this body,  
I’ve realized the end of defilements.  
I’ve gone beyond all rebirths,  
And attained the unconditioned.  

## 2.37 Lakuṇṭaka Bhaddiya  
I’m small and ugly,  
Short and dark, with little body-hair;  
People laugh at me,  
They call me “the little monk”.  

But one who’s measured by knowledge,  
By the Dhamma and virtuous conduct,  
That one is truly a great being—  
Not by form or family line.  

## 2.38 Sumaṅgala  
I’ve destroyed the taints,  
Cut the bonds,  
Completely uprooted craving,  
And abandoned the round of rebirths.  

## 2.39 Sāgata  
I’ve conquered the serpent of craving,  
I’ve crushed the army of Death.  
Having made an end to birth,  
I live free, without taints.  

## 2.40 Moggallāna the Great  
When I had understood the nature of the mind,  
I made it still and unified;  
Concentrated, I realized  
The ending of all fetters.  

## 2.41 Visākhā  
I’ve gone beyond birth and death,  
And reached the end of suffering.  
This body, so frail and transient,  
Will not be reborn again.  

## 2.42 Cūḷapanthaka  
Through laziness and lack of effort,  
I was unable to memorize even a verse.  
But the Buddha, compassionate and kind,  
Taught me the essence of the Dhamma.  

With a handful of dust as a simile,  
He made me realize impermanence;  
Now my mind is well-liberated,  
I’ve attained the end of suffering.  

## 2.43 Kulla  
In the forest I dwell alone,  
Peaceful, free from fear;  
No noise disturbs my meditation—  
I live in happiness.  

## 2.44 Ānanda  
All conditions are impermanent,  
Subject to arising and passing away.  
Having arisen, they cease;  
Their stilling is true bliss.  

## 2.45 Raṭṭhapāla  
The world is unstable,  
And doesn’t last long.  
It’s filled with suffering;  
There’s no shelter, no protector.  

Having understood the truth,  
I’ve gone forth from home to homelessness;  
I’ve attained the unconditioned,  
The stilling of all formations.  

## 2.46 Bhaddiya Kāligodhāputta  
In a forest full of lions,  
Among tigers and leopards,  
I dwell alone in happiness,  
Without fear or trembling.  

## 2.47 Kaḷudāyi  
A monk should delight in the wilderness,  
Should be at peace, with few desires.  
He should live happily in the forest,  
Mindful, energetic, and calm.  

## 2.48 Ekavihāriya  
In the wilderness I dwell alone,  
Peaceful, free from fear;  
No noise disturbs my meditation—  
I live in happiness.  

Having crossed the flood,  
I’ve reached the far shore;  
Without taints, I’m quenched,  
Truly at peace.  

## 2.49 Mahākappina  
Seeing the Dhamma, I was freed;  
My mind is liberated, without taints.  
Having realized the destruction of craving,  
I’ve attained nibbāna—cool, quenched, and free.
