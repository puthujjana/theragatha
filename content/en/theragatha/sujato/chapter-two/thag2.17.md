## 2.17 Tissa  

When your head is shaven,  
And you’re wrapped in the outer robe,  
You’ll have many enemies  
When you receive food and drink,  
Clothes and lodgings.  

Knowing this danger,  
This great fear in honours,  
A monk should go forth mindfully,  
With few possessions, and not full of desire.
