## 2.11 Mahācunda  

It is from wishing to learn that learning grows;  
When you are learned, understanding grows;  
Through understanding, you know the goal;  
Knowing the goal brings happiness.  

Make use of secluded lodgings!  
Practice to be released from fetters!  
If you don’t find enjoyment there,  
Live in the Saṅgha, guarded and mindful.
