## 2.10 Vasabha  

First one kills oneself,  
Then one kills others.  
One kills oneself, really dead,  
Like one who kills birds using a dead bird as a decoy.  

A holy man’s color is not on the outside;  
A holy man is colored on the inside.  
Whoever does bad deeds  
Such a one is truly dark, Sujampati.
