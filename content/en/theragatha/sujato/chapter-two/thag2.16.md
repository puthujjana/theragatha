## 2.16 Mahākāḷa  

There’s a big black woman who looks like a crow.  
She broke off thigh-bones, first one then another;  
She broke off arm-bones, first one then another;  
She broke off a skull like a curd-bowl, and then—  
She assembled them all together  
And sat down beside them.  

When an ignorant person builds up attachments,  
That idiot returns to suffering, again and again.  
So let one who understands not build up attachments:  
May I never again lie with a broken skull!
