## 2.8 Surādha  

Rebirth is ended for me,  
The conqueror’s instruction is fulfilled,  
What they call a “net” is abandoned,  
The attachment to being reborn  
In any state of existence is undone.  

I’ve arrived at the goal  
For the sake of which I went forth  
From the home life into homelessness:  
The ending of all fetters.
