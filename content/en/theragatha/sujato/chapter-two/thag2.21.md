## 2.21 Uttara  

I’ve fully understood the aggregates,  
I’ve undone craving;  
I’ve developed the factors of awakening,  
And I’ve realized the ending of defilements.  

Having fully understood the aggregates,  
Having plucked out the weaver of the web,  
Having developed the factors of awakening,  
I’ll realize nibbāna, without defilements.
