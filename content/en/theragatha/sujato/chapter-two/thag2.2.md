## 2.2 Piṇḍolabhāradvāja  

You can’t live by fasting,  
But food doesn’t lead to peace of heart.  
Seeing how the body is sustained by food,  
I wander, seeking.  

They know it’s a swamp,  
This worship and homage from respectable families;  
A subtle dart, hard to pull out;  
It’s hard for a corrupt person to give up honour.
