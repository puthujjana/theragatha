## 2.32 Nitta  

This body is a disease,  
A lump, a boil, a wound;  
It’s tormented, miserable, and frail,  
A putrid thing, oozing with filth.  

I have realized the truth about this body—  
Truly, it’s impermanent and not-self.  
Having gone beyond all suffering,  
I’m cooled, quenched, and free.
