## 2.42 Cūḷapanthaka  

Through laziness and lack of effort,  
I was unable to memorize even a verse.  
But the Buddha, compassionate and kind,  
Taught me the essence of the Dhamma.  

With a handful of dust as a simile,  
He made me realize impermanence;  
Now my mind is well-liberated,  
I’ve attained the end of suffering.
