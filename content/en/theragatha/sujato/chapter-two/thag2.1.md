## 2.1 Uttara  

No life is permanent,  
And no conditions last forever.  
The aggregates are reborn  
And pass away, again and again.  

Knowing this danger,  
I’m not interested in being reborn  
Into any state of existence.  
I’ve escaped all sensual pleasures,  
And attained the end of defilements.
