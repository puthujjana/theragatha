## 5.10 Yasadatta  

With fault-finding mind, the dullard  
Listens to the conqueror’s teaching.  
They’re as far from true Dhamma,  
As the earth is from the sky.  

With fault-finding mind, the dullard  
Listens to the conqueror’s teaching.  
They decline in the true Dhamma,  
Like the moon in the waning fortnight.  

With fault-finding mind, the dullard  
Listens to the conqueror’s teaching.  
They wither away in the true Dhamma,  
Like a fish in too little water.  

With fault-finding mind, the dullard  
Listens to the conqueror’s teaching.  
They don’t thrive in the true Dhamma,  
Like a rotten seed in a field.  

But one with contented mind  
Who listens to the conqueror’s teachings—  
Having ended all defilements,  
Having witnessed the unshakable,  
Having arrived at the highest peace—  
They realize nibbāna without defilements.
