## 5.11 Soṇakuṭikaṇṇa  

I’ve received full ordination,  
I am liberated, without defilements,  
I’ve seen the Blessed One myself,  
And even stayed together with him.  

The Blessed One, the teacher,  
Spent much of the night in the open;  
Then he, who is so skilled at dwelling in meditation,  
Entered his dwelling.  

Spreading out his outer robe,  
Gotama made his bed;  
Like a lion in a rocky cave,  
With fear and dread abandoned.  

Then, with lovely enunciation,  
Soṇa, a disciple of the Buddha,  
Recited the true Dhamma  
In the presence of the best of Buddhas.  

When he has fully understood the five aggregates,  
Developed the straight path,  
And arrived at the highest peace,  
He will realize nibbāna without defilements.
