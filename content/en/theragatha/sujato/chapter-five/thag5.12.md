## 5.12 Kosiya  

Whatever wise person,  
Understanding their teacher’s words,  
Stays with them, their affection growing;  
That wise person is indeed devoted—  
Knowing about Dhammas, they’re distinguished.  

When extreme stresses arise,  
Whoever does not tremble, but reflects instead,  
That wise person is indeed strong—  
Knowing about Dhammas, they’re distinguished.  

Steady as the ocean, imperturbable,  
Their wisdom is deep, and they see the subtle goal;  
That wise person is indeed immovable—  
Knowing about Dhammas, they’re distinguished.  

They’re very learned, and have memorized the Dhamma,  
Practising Dhamma in accordance with Dhamma;  
That wise person is indeed such—  
Knowing about Dhammas, they’re distinguished.  

They know the meaning of what is said,  
And having known, they act appropriately;  
That wise person is indeed  
One who has mastered the meaning—  
Knowing about Dhammas, they’re distinguished.
