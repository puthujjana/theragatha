## 5.7 Gayākassapa  

Three times a day—  
Morning, midday, and evening—  
I went down into the water at Gayā,  
For the Gayā spring festival.  

“Whatever bad things I’ve done  
In previous births,  
I’ll now wash away right here”—  
This is the view I previously held.  

Having heard the well-spoken words  
Regarding the Dhamma and the goal,  
I wisely reflected  
On the true, essential goal.  

I’ve washed away all bad things;  
I’m stainless, cleansed, pristine;  
The pure heir of the pure one,  
A rightful son of the Buddha.  

When I plunged into the eight-fold stream,  
All bad things were washed away.  
I’ve attained the three knowledges,  
And fulfilled the Buddha’s instructions.
