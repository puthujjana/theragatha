## 5.4 Sumana  

My mentor helped me to learn,  
Hoping that I would practice those teachings;  
Aspiring for the deathless,  
I’ve done what was to be done.  

I’ve arrived at the Dhamma,  
And witnessed it for myself, not based on hearsay.  
With purified knowledge, free of doubt,  
I declare it in your presence.  

I know my past life;  
My clairvoyance is clarified;  
I’ve realized my own true goal,  
The Buddha’s instruction is fulfilled.  

Being heedful in the training,  
I have learned your teachings well.  
All my defilements are ended;  
Now there is no more rebirth  
Into any state of existence.  

You advised me in noble ways;  
Compassionate, you helped teach me;  
Your instruction was not in vain—  
I, your student, am fully trained.
