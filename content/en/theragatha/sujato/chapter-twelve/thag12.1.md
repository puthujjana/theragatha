## 12.1 Sīlava  


One should train just in virtue,  
For in this world, when virtue is  
Cultivated and well-trained,  
It provides all success.  

Desiring three kinds of happiness—  
Praise, prosperity,  
And to delight in heaven after passing away—  
The wise should protect virtue.  

The well-behaved have many friends,  
Because of their self-restraint.  
But one without virtue, of bad conduct,  
Drives away their friends.  

A person of bad behavior has  
Ill-repute and infamy.  
A person of virtue always has  
A good reputation, fame, and praise.  

Virtue is the starting point and foundation;  
The mother at the head  
Of all good qualities:  
Therefore you should purify virtue.  

Virtue is a boundary and a restraint,  
An enjoyment for the mind;  
The place where all the Buddhas cross over:  
Therefore you should purify virtue.  

Virtue is the matchless power;  
Virtue is the ultimate weapon;  
Virtue is the best ornament;  
Virtue is a marvellous coat of armour.  

Virtue is a mighty bridge;  
Virtue is the unsurpassed scent;  
Virtue is the best perfume,  
That floats in all directions.  

Virtue is the best provision;  
Virtue is the unsurpassed supply for a journey;  
Virtue is the best vehicle,  
That takes you in all directions.  

In this life they’re criticized;  
After passing away they’re unhappy in a lower realm;  
A fool is unhappy everywhere,  
Because they are not endowed with virtues.  

In this life they’re famous;  
After passing away they’re happy in heaven;  
A person with understanding is happy everywhere,  
Because they are endowed with virtues.  

Virtue is best in this life,  
But a person with understanding is supreme  
Among humans and gods,  
Conquering with virtue and understanding.
