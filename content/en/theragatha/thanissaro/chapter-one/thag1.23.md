# 1.23 Gosāla

I—having eaten honey-rice  
in a bamboo patch  
and rightly grasping the aggregates’[^1]  
arising-disbanding—  
will return to the hillside, intent  
on seclusion.  

## Notes

[^1]: The aggregates of form, feeling, perception, fabrication, and consciousness. See SN 22:48, SN 22:59, and SN 22:79.
