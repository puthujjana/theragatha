# 1.118 Kimbila

As if sent by a curse,[^1]  
it drops on us—  
aging.  
The body seems     other,  
though it’s still the same one.  
I’m still here  
& have never been absent from it,  
but I remember myself  
as if somebody else’s.  

## Notes

[^1]: Reading abhisatto with the Sinhalese and Burmese editions. The Thai and PTS have abhisattho, “ordered.”
