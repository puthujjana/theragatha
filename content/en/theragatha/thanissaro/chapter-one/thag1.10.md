# 1.10 Puṇṇamāsa

Whoever,  
a master of knowing,  
contented,[^1]  
restrained in mind,  
destroys longing for here & beyond,  
unsmeared with regard to all dhammas,  
would know the arising-&-disbanding  
of the world.  

## Notes

[^1]: Reading santusito with the Thai edition. Other editions have samito—calmed, appeased—which doesn’t fit the meter.
