# 1.86 Nāgita

Outside of this path,  
the path of the many  
who teach other things  
doesn’t go to unbinding  
as does this:  
Thus the Blessed One  
instructs the Saṅgha,  
truly showing the palms of his hands.[^1]  

## Notes

[^1]: This is a reference to the fact that the Buddha was an “open-handed” teacher who did not wait to the end of his life to give his most crucial teachings. See DN 16. The message of this verse may be related to the fact that the Buddha addressed three of his most plain-speaking suttas to Nāgita: AN 5:30, AN 6:42, and AN 8:103.
