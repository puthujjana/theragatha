# 1.41 Sirivaḍḍha

Lightning lands on the cleft
between Vebhāra & Paṇḍava,[^1]
but,
having gone to the cleft in the mountains,
he’s absorbed in jhāna[^2]—the son
of the one without compare,
the one who is Such.[^3]

## Notes

[^1]: Mountains near Rājagaha.

[^2]: Meditative absorption, one of the four levels of intense concentration that constitute right concentration in the noble eightfold path.

[^3]: Such (tādin): an epithet for an arahant, indicating that his/her attainment is indefinable and not subject to change.
