# 1.33 Sopāka

Just as one would be good  
to one’s dear only child,  
one should be good to all creatures  
everywhere.[^1]  

## Notes

Note

[^1]: Notice how this image differs from a similar image in Sn 1:8:

As a mother would risk her life

to protect her child, her only child,

even so should one cultivate the heart limitlessly

with regard to all beings.

Whereas the image here draws a parallel between being good to one’s child and being good to others, the image in Sn 1:8 draws a parallel between protecting one’s child and protecting one’s limitless attitude of goodwill to all beings.
