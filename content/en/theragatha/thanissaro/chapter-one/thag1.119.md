# 1.119 Vajjiputta

Coming to the bower  
at the root of a tree,  
placing  
unbinding  
in your heart,  
do jhāna, Gotama,  
& don’t be heedless.  
What use is this  
chitter-chatter  
to you?[^1]  

## Notes

[^1]: In SN 9:5, a deva addresses this verse to Ven. Ānanda, who has been spending too much time teaching Dhamma to laypeople.
