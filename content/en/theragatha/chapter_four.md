# Chapter Four

*Translated by Bhikkhu Sujato.*

## 4.1 Nāgasamāla  

There’s a dancer along the highway,  
Dancing as the music plays;  
She’s adorned with jewellery and all dressed up,  
With a garland of flowers  
And perfume of sandalwood.  

I entered for alms,  
And while going along I glanced at her,  
Adorned with jewellery and all dressed up,  
Like a snare of death laid down.  

Then the realization  
Came upon me—  
The danger became clear,  
And I was firmly repulsed.  

Then my mind was liberated—  
See the excellence of the Dhamma!  
I’ve attained the three knowledges,  
And fulfilled the Buddha’s instructions.  

## 4.2 Bhagu  

Overwhelmed by drowsiness,  
I came out of my dwelling;  
Stepping up on to the walking meditation path,  
I fell to the ground right there.  

I rubbed my limbs, and again  
I stepped up on to the walking meditation path.  
I walked meditation up and down the path,  
Serene inside myself.  

Then the realization  
Came upon me—  
The danger became clear,  
And I was firmly repulsed.  

Then my mind was liberated—  
See the excellence of the Dhamma!  
I’ve attained the three knowledges,  
And fulfilled the Buddha’s instructions.  

## 4.3 Sabhiya  

Others don’t understand  
That here we come to our end.  
Those that do understand this  
Settle their quarrels because of that.  

And when those who don’t understand  
Behave as though they were immortal;  
Those who understand the Dhamma  
Are like the healthy among the sick.  

Any lax act,  
Or corrupt religious observance,  
Or a spiritual life arousing suspicion,  
Does not yield great fruit.  

Whoever has no respect  
For their companions in the spiritual life  
Is as far from true Dhamma  
As the sky is from the earth.  

## 4.4 Nandaka  

Damn these stinking bodies!  
They’re on Māra’s side, they ooze;  
And bodies have nine streams  
That are always flowing.  

Don’t think much of bodies;  
Don’t disparage the Tathāgathas.  
They’re not even aroused by heaven,  
Let alone by humans.  

But those dumb fools,  
With bad advisors, shrouded in delusion,  
That kind of person is aroused by bodies,  
When Māra has thrown the snare.  

Those who have discarded  
Lust, hatred, and ignorance:  
They’ve cut the strings, they’re no longer bound—  
Such people are not aroused by bodies.  

## 4.5 Jambuka  

For fifty-five years  
I wore mud and dirt;  
Eating one meal a month,  
I tore out my hair and beard.  

I stood on one foot;  
I rejected seats;  
I ate dried-out dung;  
I didn’t accept food that had been set aside for me.  

Having done many actions of this kind,  
Which lead to a bad destination,  
As I was being swept away by the great flood,  
I went to the Buddha for refuge.  

See the going for refuge!  
See the excellence of the Dhamma!  
I’ve attained the three knowledges,  
And fulfilled the Buddha’s instructions.  

## 4.6 Senaka  

During the spring festival at Gayā,  
It was so welcome for me  
To see the Buddha,  
Teaching the supreme Dhamma.  

He was glorious, the teacher of a community,  
Who had realised the highest, a leader,  
Conqueror of the world with its gods;  
His vision was unequalled.  

A great being of power, a great hero,  
A great light, without defilements.  
With the utter ending of all defilements,  
The teacher has no fear from any direction.  

For a long time, sadly, I was corrupted,  
Fettered by the bond of wrong view.  
That Blessed One, Senaka,  
Released me from all ties.  

## 4.7 Sambhūta  

Hurrying when it’s time for going slowly;  
Going slowly when it’s time to hurry;  
That fool falls into suffering  
Because of these muddled arrangements.  

Their good fortune wastes away  
Like the moon in the waning fortnight;  
They become disgraced,  
And alienated from their friends.  

Going slowly when it’s time for going slowly;  
Hurrying when it’s time to hurry;  
That wise person comes into happiness  
Because of these proper arrangements.  

Their good fortune flourishes  
Like the moon in the waxing fortnight;  
They become famous and respected,  
Not alienated from their friends.  

## 4.8 Rāhula  

I am known as “Fortunate Rāhula”,  
Because I’m endowed in both ways:  
I am the son of the Buddha,  
And I have the vision of the Dhammas.  

Since my defilements have ended,  
Since there is no more being reborn  
In any state of existence—  
I’m an Arahant, worthy of offerings,  
With the three knowledges  
And the vision of the deathless.  

Blinded by sensual pleasures, trapped in a net,  
They are smothered over by craving,  
Bound by the Kinsman of the Negligent,  
Like a fish caught in a funnel-net trap.  

Having thrown off those sensual pleasures,  
Having cut Māra’s bond,  
Having pulled out craving, roots and all:  
I’ve become cool, and realized nibbāna.  

## 4.9 Candana  

Covered with gold,  
Surrounded by all her maids,  
With my son upon her hip,  
My wife came up to me.  

I saw her coming,  
The mother of my son,  
Adorned with jewellery and all dressed up,  
Like a snare of death laid down.  

Then the realization  
Came upon me—  
The danger became clear,  
And I was firmly repulsed.  

Then my mind was liberated—  
See the excellence of the Dhamma!  
I’ve attained the three knowledges,  
And fulfilled the Buddha’s instructions.  

## 4.11 Dhammika  

“Dhamma really protects you if you practice Dhamma;  
Dhamma well-practiced brings happiness.  
If you practice Dhamma, this is the benefit—  
You won’t go to a bad destination.  

Dhamma and what is not Dhamma  
Don’t both lead to the same results.  
What is not Dhamma leads to hell,  
While Dhamma takes you to a good destination.  

So you should be enthusiastic  
To perform acts of Dhamma,  
Rejoicing in the Fortunate One, the poised.  
Disciples of the best of Fortunate Ones  
Are firm in Dhamma;  
Those wise ones are led on,  
Going to the very best of refuges.”  

“The boil has been burst from its root,  
The net of craving is undone.  
He has ended transmigration, he has nothing,  
Just like the full moon in a clear night sky.”  

## 4.12 Sappaka  

When the crane with its beautiful white wings,  
Startled by fear of the dark thundercloud,  
Flees, seeking shelter—  
Then the River Ajakaraṇī delights me.  

When the crane, so pure and white,  
Startled by fear of the dark thundercloud,  
Seeks for a cave to shelter in, but can’t see one—  
Then the River Ajakaraṇī delights me.  

Who wouldn’t be delighted  
By the rose-apple trees  
That adorn both banks of the river there,  
Behind my cave?  

Rid of snakes, that death-mad swarm,  
The lazy frogs croak:  
“Today isn’t the time to stray from mountain streams;  
Ajakaraṇī is safe, pleasant, and delightful.”  

## 4.13 Mudita  

I went forth to save my life;  
But I gained faith  
After receiving full ordination;  
And I strove, strong in effort.  

With pleasure, let this body be broken!  
Let this lump of flesh be dissolved!  
Let both my legs fall off  
At the knees!  

I won’t eat, I won’t drink,  
I won’t leave my dwelling,  
Nor will I lie down on my side,  
Until the dart of craving is drawn out.  

As I dwell like this,  
See my energy and striving!  
I’ve attained the three knowledges,  
And fulfilled the Buddha’s instructions.
