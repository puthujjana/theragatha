# Chapter 6

*Translated by Bhikkhu Sujato.*

## 6.1 Uruveḷakassapa  

When I saw the marvels  
Of the renowned Gotama,  
I didn’t immediately bow to him;  
I was blinded by jealousy and conceit.  

Knowing what I was thinking,  
The trainer of men spurred me on;  
And I was struck with a marvellous inspiration,  
That gave me goose-bumps.  

Rejecting my petty accomplishments  
When I used to be a matted-hair ascetic,  
I then went forth,  
In the conqueror’s teaching.  

I used to be content with sacrifice,  
Giving priority to the realm of sensual pleasures,  
But later I uprooted desire,  
And hatred and also delusion.  

I know my past life;  
My clairvoyance is clarified;  
I have psychic powers,  
And I know the minds of others;  
I have realised the divine ear.  

I’ve attained the goal  
For the sake of which I went forth  
From home life into homelessness—  
The ending of all fetters.  


## 6.2 Tekicchakāri  

“The rice has been harvested,  
And gathered on the threshing-floor—  
But I don’t get any alms-food!  
How will I get by?”  

“Recollect the immeasurable Buddha!  
Confident, your body pervaded with rapture,  
You’ll always be full of joy.  

Recollect the immeasurable Dhamma!  
Confident, your body pervaded with rapture,  
You’ll always be full of joy.  

Recollect the immeasurable Saṅgha!  
Confident, your body pervaded with rapture,  
You’ll always be full of joy.”  

“You stay in the open,  
Though these winter nights are cold.  

Don’t perish, overcome with cold;  
Enter your dwelling, with its door shut fast.”  

“I’ll realise the four immeasurable states,  
And dwell happily with them.  
I won’t perish, overcome with cold;  
I’ll dwell unperturbed.”  


## 6.3 Mahānāga  

Whoever has no respect  
For their companions in the spiritual life  
Falls away from the true Dhamma,  
Like a fish in too little water.  

Whoever has no respect  
For their companions in the spiritual life  
Doesn’t thrive in the true Dhamma,  
Like a rotten seed in a field.  

Whoever has no respect  
For their companions in the spiritual life  
Is far from nibbāna,  
In the teaching of the Dhamma king.  

Whoever does have respect  
For their companions in the spiritual life  
Doesn’t fall away from the true Dhamma,  
Like a fish in plenty of water.  

Whoever does have respect  
For their companions in the spiritual life  
Thrives in the true Dhamma,  
Like a quality seed in a field.  

Whoever does have respect  
For their companions in the spiritual life  
Is close to nibbāna,  
In the teaching of the Dhamma king.  


## 6.4 Kulla  

I, Kulla, went to a charnel ground  
And saw a woman left there,  
Discarded in a cemetery,  
Full of worms that devoured her.  

See this body, Kulla—  
Diseased, filthy, rotten,  
Oozing and trickling,  
A fools’ delight.  

Taking Dhamma as a mirror  
For realizing knowledge and vision,  
I reviewed this body,  
Vacant, inside and out.  

As this is, so is that;  
As that is, so is this.  
As below, so above;  
As above, so below.  

As by day, so by night;  
As by night, so by day.  
As before, so after;  
As after, so before.  

Not even music played by a five-piece band,  
Can give such pleasure  
As there is for one with unified mind,  
Discerning the Dhamma rightly.  


## 6.5 Mālukyaputta  

For a person who lives heedlessly,  
Craving grows like a parasitic creeper.  
They jump from here to there, like a monkey  
That wants fruit in a forest grove.  

Whoever is overcome by this wretched craving,  
This attachment to the world,  
Their sorrow grows,  
Like grass in the rain.  

But whoever overcomes this wretched craving,  
This attachment to the world,  
Their sorrows fall from them,  
Like a water-drop from a lotus.  

I say this to you, venerables,  
All those who have gathered here:  
Dig up the root of craving,  
Like someone who is looking for roots  
Will dig up the grass.  
Don’t let Māra break you again and again,  
Like a stream breaking a reed.  

Act on the Buddha’s words,  
Don’t let the moment pass you by.  
Those who pass up the moment  
Grieve when they end up in hell.  

Heedlessness is always an impurity,  
Impurity comes from heedlessness.  
With heedfulness and knowledge,  
Pluck out your own dart.
