# Chapter One

*Translated by Bhikkhu Sujato.*

## 1.1 Subhūti  
My little hut is roofed and pleasant,  
Sheltered from the wind:  
So rain, sky, as you please!  
My mind is serene and freed,  
I practice whole-heartedly: so rain, sky!  

## 1.2 Mahākoṭṭhika  
Calm and quiet,  
Wise in counsel and steady;  
Shaking off bad qualities,  
As the wind shakes leaves off a tree.  

## 1.3 Kaṅkhārevata  
See this wisdom of the Tathāgatas!  
Like a fire blazing in the night,  
Giving light, giving vision,  
Dispelling the doubt of those who’ve come here.  

## 1.4 Puṇṇa  
You should only associate with the wise,  
Those intent upon good, seeing the goal.  
Being wise, heedful, and discerning,  
They realise the goal, so great, profound,  
Hard to see, subtle, and fine.  

## 1.5 Dabba  
Once hard to tame, now tamed themselves,  
Worthy, content, crossed over doubt.  
Victorious, with fears vanished,  
Dabba is steadfast, and has realized nibbāna.  

## 1.6 Sītavaniya  
The monk who went to Sītavana is alone,  
Content, practicing samādhi,  
Victorious, with goosebumps vanished,  
Guarding mindfulness of the body, resolute.  

## 1.7 Bhalliya  
He has swept away the army of the king of death,  
Like a great flood sweeping away  
A fragile bridge of reeds.  
Victorious, with fears vanished,  
He is tamed and steadfast, and has realized nibbāna.  

## 1.8 Vīra  
Once hard to tame, now tamed himself,  
A hero, content, with doubt overcome,  
Victorious, with goosebumps vanished,  
Vīra is steadfast, and has realized nibbāna.  

## 1.9 Pilindavaccha  
It was welcome, not unwelcome,  
The advice I got was good.  
Of things which are shared,  
I encountered the best.  

## 1.10 Puṇṇamāsa  
One who is accomplished in knowledge,  
Peaceful and restrained,  
Doesn’t expect to dwell in this world or the next.  
Without clinging to anything,  
They know the arising and passing of the world.  

## 1.11 Cūḷavaccha  
A monk with much joy  
In the Dhamma taught by the Buddha  
Would realise the peaceful state:  
The stilling of activities, bliss.  

## 1.12 Mahāvaccha  
Empowered by wisdom,  
Endowed with virtue and vows,  
Possessing samādhi, delighting in jhāna, mindful,  
Eating suitable food,  
One should bide one’s time here, free of desire.  

## 1.13 Vanavaccha  
They look like blue-black storm clouds, glistening,  
Cooled with the waters of clear-flowing streams,  
And covered with ladybird beetles:  
These rocky crags delight me!  

## 1.14 Novice Sivaka  
My preceptor said:  
“Let’s go from here, Sīvaka.”  
My body lives in the village,  
But my mind has gone to the wilderness.  
I’ll go there even if I’m lying down;  
There’s no tying down one who understands.  

## 1.15 Kuṇḍadhāna  
Five should be cut off, five should be abandoned,  
Five more should be developed.  
A monk who has overcome five attachments  
Is called “One who has crossed the flood”.  

## 1.16 Belaṭṭhasīsa  
Just as a fine thoroughbred  
Proceeds with ease,  
Tail and mane flying in the wind;  
So my days and nights  
Proceed with ease,  
Full of spiritual joy.  

## 1.17 Dāsaka  
One who is drowsy, a glutton,  
Fond of sleep, rolling as they lie,  
Like a great hog stuffed with food:  
That fool is reborn again and again.  

## 1.18 Siṅgālapitu  
There was an heir of the Buddha,  
A monk in Bhesakaḷā forest,  
Who suffused the entire earth  
With the perception of “bones”.  
I think he will quickly abandon sensual desire.  

## 1.19 Kula  
Irrigators lead water,  
Fletchers shape arrows,  
Carpenters shape wood;  
The disciplined tame themselves.  

## 1.20 Ajita  
I do not fear death;  
Nor do I long for life.  
I’ll lay down this body,  
Aware and mindful.  

## 1.21 Nigrodha  
I’m not afraid of fear.  
Our teacher is skilled in the deathless;  
Monks proceed by the path  
Where no fear remains.  

## 1.22 Cittaka  
Crested peacocks with beautiful blue necks  
Cry out in Karaṃvī.  
Aroused by a cool breeze,  
They awaken the sleeper to practice jhāna.  

## 1.23 Gosāla  
I’ll eat honey and rice in Veḷugumba,  
And then, skilfully scrutinizing  
The rise and fall of the aggregates,  
I’ll return to my forest hill,  
And devote myself to seclusion.  

## 1.24 Sugandha  
I went forth after the rainy season—  
See the excellence of the Dhamma!  
I’ve attained the three knowledges  
And fulfilled the Buddha’s instructions.  

## 1.25 Nandaka  
They gather together,  
Discussing the Teacher’s words.  
Truly wise and mindful,  
They practice the teaching day and night.  

## 1.26 Abhaya  
If you want to do something,  
Then work on it with all your might.  
A lax monastic life  
Just leads to regret.  

## 1.27 Lomasakaṅgiya  
When you’ve developed these things—  
Mindfulness, investigation of principles,  
Energy, rapture, tranquility,  
Samādhi, and equanimity—  
And understanding through insight  
The Dhamma of higher wisdom,  
You’ll end suffering and stress.  

## 1.28 Jambugāmika Tissa  
“What is the one thing,” said the wanderer,  
“That a mendicant must rightly explain?”  
“The one thing,” said Tissa,  
“Is suffering, which the Blessed One declared.”  
“Well then, what is the path,” said the wanderer,  
“For ending suffering and stress?”  
“The noble eightfold path,” said Tissa,  
“Is the path declared by the Blessed One.”  

## 1.29 Sāmidatta  
“Though you’ve gone forth, young man,  
Your heart’s still stuck in the world.”  
“You speak truth, venerable sir,  
And I admit it: that’s how it is for me.  
But I’ll train to give up the world,  
And not let the world get the better of me.”  

## 1.30 Paripuṇṇa  
Whatever a person should do for their own good,  
Let them do that with due care and effort.  
For a monastic who’s lax,  
Can never make much progress in Dhamma.  

## 1.31 Vijitasena  
One should look for a teacher,  
Who is learned, intelligent, wise,  
Practised in samādhi, and energetic;  
Having learned from such a person,  
One should live in line with the Dhamma.  

## 1.32 Yasadatta  
Sensual pleasures are like swords and stakes;  
The aggregates are like their chopping block.  
What you call happiness here in the world  
Is the exhaustion of foolish people.  

## 1.33 Soṇa  
Before, my heart was agitated,  
Running after sensual pleasures.  
But now I’ve tamed, stilled,  
And fully quenched it.  

## 1.34 Rāmaṇeyyaka  
You mustn’t go back to the old path  
That leads to lowly states.  
Don’t become a person  
Who lusts after sense pleasures, lazy and slack.  

## 1.35 Samiddhi  
I’ve overcome the powerful armies,  
The five defilements in this body.  
So I delight alone,  
Having reached peace and seclusion.  

## 1.36 Ujjaya  
Beings flow along,  
Like fish in a stream.  
When touched by old age,  
They leap up like fish in a drying pond.  

## 1.37 Sañjaya  
It’s not proper for a monk  
To strive for worldly gains.  
The wise, seeking happiness,  
Should purify their mind.

The wilderness is delightful,  
Where ordinary people find no joy.  
There the passionless will rejoice,  
For they seek no sensual pleasures.

Mindful, seeking peace.  
I found the Dhamma of liberation,  
Leading to the stilling of suffering.

I’ve understood all the aggregates,  
Seen their origin and passing away.  
I’m freed through understanding,  
Completely quenched, without defilements.

Seeing the aggregates as suffering,  
Empty, not-self, and void,  
I’ve given up all defilements,  
And reached the peace of nibbāna.

For the stilling of all activities,  
For the abandoning of all attachments,  
For the ending of craving,  
For dispassion, cessation, and nibbāna.  

## 1.44 Ujjaya (3)  
Those who have destroyed the taints,  
Who are poised and free from craving,  
Whose faculties are peaceful,  
Such ones are rightly called “Peaceful”.

See the great excellence of the wise:  
They’ve crossed the flood,  
They’ve cut off the chain,  
And they’re freed from all suffering.

The seers who have cut off craving,  
Who have crossed the flood,  
Who are freed in the ending of craving,  
They’ve reached the far shore, the peaceful state.  

## 1.50 Sāmidatta  
“Though you’ve gone forth, young man,  
Your heart’s still stuck in the world.”  
“You speak truth, venerable sir,  
And I admit it: that’s how it is for me.  
But I’ll train to give up the world,  
And not let the world get the better of me.”  

## 1.51 Paripuṇṇa

## 1.98 Abhaya  
If you focus on the pleasant aspect  
Of sights that you see, you’ll lose your mindfulness.

## 1.101 Belaṭṭhānika  
He’s given up the household life,  
But he has no purpose,  
Like a big pig that chomps on grain,  
Using his snout as a plough, living for his belly, lazy:  
That idiot comes to the womb again and again.  

## 1.102 Setuccha  
Deceived by conceit,  
Defiled by conditions,  
Distressed by gain and loss,  
They don’t realise samādhi.  

## 1.103 Bandhura  
I don’t need this—  
I’m satisfied and pleased with the sweet Dhamma.  
I’ve drunk the best, the supreme nectar:  
I won’t go near poison.  

## 1.104 Khitaka  
Hey! My body is light,  
Full of so much rapture and happiness.  
My body feels like it’s floating,  
Like cotton on the wind.  

## 1.105 Malitavambha  
Dissatisfied, one should not stay;  
Happy, one should depart.  
One who sees clearly wouldn’t stay  
In a place that was not conducive to the goal.  

## 1.106 Suhemanta  
When the meaning has a hundred aspects,  
And carries a hundred characteristics,  
The fool sees only one factor,  
While the sage sees a hundred.

## 1.109 Saṃgharakkhita  
He’s gone on retreat,  
But he doesn’t yet heed the counsel  
Of the one with supreme compassion  
For his welfare.  
He lives with unrestrained faculties,  
Like a young deer in the woods.  

## 1.110 Usabha  
The trees on the mountain-tops have grown well,  
Freshly sprinkled by towering clouds.  
For Usabha, who loves seclusion,  
And who thinks only of wilderness,  
Goodness arises more and more.  

## 1.111 Jenta  
Going forth is hard, living at home is hard,  
Dhamma is profound,  
And money is hard to come by.  
Getting by is difficult  
For we who accept whatever comes,  
So we should always remember impermanence.  

## 1.112 Vacchagotta  
I have the three knowledges, I’m a great meditator,  
Skilled in serenity of mind.  
I’ve realized my own true goal,  
And fulfilled the Buddha’s instructions.  

## 1.113 Vanavaccha  
The water is clear and the gorges are wide,  
Monkeys and deer are all around;  
Festooned with dewy moss,  
These rocky crags delight me!  

## 1.114 Adhimutta  
When your body is uncomfortably heavy,  
While life is running out;  
Greedy for physical pleasure,  
How can you find happiness as an ascetic?  

## 1.115 Mahānāma  
By Mount Nesādaka,  
With its famous covering  
Of many shrubs and trees,  
You’re found deficient.  

## 1.116 Pārāpariya  
I’ve abandoned the six spheres of sense-contact,  
My sense-doors are guarded and well restrained;  
I’ve ejected the root of misery,  
And attained the end of defilements.  

## 1.117 Yasa  
I’m well-anointed and well-dressed,  
Adorned with all my jewellery.  
I’ve attained the three knowledges  
And fulfilled the Buddha’s instructions.  

## 1.118 Kimila  
Old age falls like a curse;  
It’s the same body, but it seems like someone else’s.  
I remember myself as if I was someone else,  
But I’m still the same, I haven’t been away.  

## 1.119 Vajjiputta  
You’ve gone to the jungle, the root of a tree,  
Putting nibbāna in your heart.  
Practice jhāna, Gotama, don’t be heedless.  
What is this hullabaloo to you?  

## 1.120 Isidatta  
The five aggregates are fully understood,  
They remain, but their root is severed.  
I have realized the end of suffering,  
And attained the end of defilements.
